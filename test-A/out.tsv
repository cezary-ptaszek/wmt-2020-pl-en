A new survey of546 children aged 12 to 18 found that 82% of respondents feel helpless about plastic waste and 25% blame adults for the problem with waste from disposable plastic packaging.
The study revealed that plastic waste was also the fourth largest concern for parents, with 93% of the 551 parents surveyed said they were concerned about the amount of plastic waste entering the oceans.
Many people who took part in the study said they wanted to do something about plastic waste, but simply did not know how to make significant changes, which led to environmental anxiety.

Memes after volleyball match in ME semi-finals
It wasn't an easy match.
The Slovens had an exuberant audience on their side, which effectively disoriented Polish volleyball players.
A lot of controversy was also aroused by the referees, who in one of the actions did not add up to four bounces on the side of the hosts.
This happened at a crucial moment in the first set, when Vital Heynen's men had a chance to leap clear their rivals and win the first game.
However, this did not happen, and the Poles ultimately had to recognize the superiority of the rival, who after a 3-1 win will play in the final of the tournament.

Google creates a cloud in Poland.
PARTNER PKO BP
The Operator of the National Cloud, PKO BP and PFR, has entered into a strategic partnership with Google.
Cooperation is intended to help Polish companies implement and exploit the potential of cloud computing technology.
Google Cloud Platform products will be included in the offer of the National Cloud Operator, and Google will open in Warsaw the so-called Google Cloud region – that is, a hub of technical infrastructure and software dedicated to customers from Poland and the Region of Central and Eastern Europe.
The Google Cloud region will be the first installation of global public cloud computing in Central Europe.
The digitization of Polish enterprises was one of the key assumptions that underpined the project to create the National Cloud, initiated and developed by PKO Bank Polski and by the Polish Development Fund, shareholders of this company.
The Partnership between The National Cloud and Google is another important step on the road that we set out less than a year ago, announcing the establishment of the National Cloud Operator.
The objective remains unchanged – digitising the Polish economy and boosting its growth.
"Now Polish companies will gain additional, sophisticated tools for its implementation.
By using them, they increase their chances of promotion to the world league, which is what we all care about.
The fact that Google joins their group today significantly strengthens our joint project", says Zbigniew Jagiełło, President of PKO Bank Polski.
The Polish Development Fund points out that it is interested in investment projects that support the development of modern industries and enterprises.
"The investment in the National Cloud Operator fits perfectly into the PFR strategy, as an important element of digitization of the country.
It will provide entrepreneurs with modern and affordable solutions based on cloud architecture.
"I am convinced that this cooperation will also have a positive impact on the development of the Polish IT market and attract the best specialists to it", adds Paweł Borys, President of PFR.
Google Cloud offers advanced technologies, products, and analytics tools based on a leading technical infrastructure that provides computing power and data storage services.
Customers in Poland will find all key Google Cloud Platform products in their service portfolio, such as Compute Engine, App Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine, Cloud Bigtable, Cloud Spanner, and BigQuery.
The inclusion of Google Cloud services in the National Cloud offer will enable Polish entrepreneurs to use exactly the same advanced technologies used by their global competitors.
Thanks to us, however, they will remain in Polish jurisdiction and under the control of local regulators", points out Michał Potoczek, President of the National Cloud Operator.
He adds that the company will be ready for megatrends such as the Internet of Things (IoT), which repeatedly increase the demand for computing power needed to process massive data sets.
6th National Seniors Parade
At noon on August 24, 2019, at the Roundabout de Gaulle in Warsaw, the 6th Senior Parade "Mature Great" and The Picnic of Generations, events organized by the Zaczyn Foundation, began.
As Przemysław Wisniewski of the Foundation stated: "The parade is a global event.
For the sixth time, she passed through the center of Warsaw to demonstrate how large and diverse the community is for seniors.
Through the Parade, we counter harmful stereotypes affecting the elderly and call for intergenerational solidarity."
The parade was led by a special double-decker coach serving as a musical mobile stage, where the traditionally famous Warsaw DJ Wika performed.
Participants in a joyous procession, at the second well-known Warsaw and world hits, went through jerusalem avenues, ul. They crumble to Warsaw's Insurgent Square, ul. Mazowiecka to J. Piłsudski Square and ul. The Royal and Cracow Suburb to the Main Campus of the University of Warsaw.
During the march, which was attended by several thousand seniors, representing 300 senior organizations from all over Poland, colorful delegations were greeted with applause by the many gathered on the route of the march, Warsaw residents and tourists.
From Legionowa, two organized groups participated in the parade, appearing in the company's t-shirts of yellow and blue color.
The first representing the University of the 3rd Century and the Senior+ Club and the second under the name SAGA, that is, the Senior Active Animator Group.
On the campus of the university, m.in prepared various gastronomic stalls and numerous stands of institutions and companies offering services and products to seniors to improve their daily life and functioning.
There were medical, cosmetic, culinary, recreational, sports and fashion stands.
For example, at the Stand of Stylish Seniors Of Senior Voice from professionals Hanna Piekarska and designer Agnieszka Wyrwał, you could get tips and information about current fashion trends 60+.
The stand also offered a workshop on learning how to move around the stage and posing for photos.
The culmination was the fashion show Stylish Seniors.
The stand of the National Senior's Voice included the latest edition of the magazine and materials related to the campaign "Stop manipulation – Do not buy at the presentation!".
Further stands offered beauty, movement, art and art workshops.

Discussion panels were also organized, including Helena Norowicz, Beata Tadli, Mariola Bojarska-Ferenc, Tomasz Jacyków and Robert Janowski.
At the picnic there were vocal and musical attractions.
On the set there was a legend of the Polish song – Krzysztof Krawczyk, and in the evening there was an intergenerational dance, led by DJ Wika.
Tasmanian devils can provide clues on cancer treatment
Tasmanian devils may hold key to cancer treatment - researchers make groundbreaking discovery that could revolutionise therapy for patients
Medical researchers have discovered a way to mask certain cancer cells
Researchers found that the same process occurs in Tasmanian devils and humans
It is hoped that this discovery will bring new treatments for cancer patients
What do Tasmanian devils and people have in common?
Cancer cells that can become invisible.
Researchers, including those from the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, have made a groundbreaking discovery that could help revolutionise the treatment of certain cancers if they do not respond to immunotherapy.
It may also contain the key to treating fatal facial tumors that threaten the future of the endangered Tasmanian devil.
The study established a way to mask certain cancer cells in both humans and marsupials using a group of proteins called PRC2, which disables a marker that would otherwise signal the immune system to attack the cancer.
This may pose the biggest challenge in treating small cell lung cancer, neuroblastoma and a type of skin cancer called Merkel cell carcinoma.
"The great importance of this project is that in patients who sometimes develop resistance to immune therapies, we may be able to reverse this process," lead researcher Mark Dawson of Peter Mac told AAP.
Existing therapies can be directed to re-incorporate markers, proteins called MHC, which will allow the immune system to recognize cancer cells.
"Potentially this has far-reaching implications for people with lung cancer," Professor Dawson said.
"This is one of the most common diseases on earth.
And perhaps we can treat it much better.
The researchers also hope that the discovery will someday be used to treat tasmanian devil face tumors, where cancer cells similarly avoid detection.
"It is remarkable that exactly the same process occurs (for cancers in humans and Tasmanian devils)," professor Dawson said.
"Until now, it has been very difficult to treat the tumors of tasmanian devils.
But if human drugs can also be used in Tasmanian devils, there is a possibility that this will help control the disease."
Scientists amazed at the fact that a very large planet orbits a really small star
Scientists are astonished by the discovery of a solar system 30 light-years from Earth that undermines our current understanding of the processes of planet formation, as a large Jupiter-like planet orbits a small star called the red dwarf.
An artist's impression of the gas giant planet GJ 3512b orbiting the red dwarf central star, published on September 26, 2019.
In general, stars are much larger than even the largest planets orbiting them.
However, as scientists said on Thursday, in this case the star and the planet slightly differ in size.
The size of a star called GJ 3512 is about 12% of the size of the Sun, while the mass of the planet that orbits it is at least half the mass of Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system.
"Yes, it's an absolute surprise," said astrophysicist Juan Carlos Morales of the Catalan Institute for Space Research at the Spanish Institute for Space Research, who led the research published in the journal Science.
The discovery is surprising because theoretical models of solar system formation suggest that low-mass stars tend to become parent stars for smaller earth-like planets or smaller Neptunes.
"In this case, we discovered a Jupiter-like gas giant planet orbiting a very small star," Morales added.
This planet, which like Earth consists mainly of gas, was discovered using a telescope at the Calar Alto Observatory in Spain.
It orbits its star in a very elliptical orbit, and the full lap lasts 204 days.
Red dwarfs are small and have a relatively low surface temperature.
The star GJ 3512 is not only much smaller than the Sun, but to some extent has a size comparable to the size of a very large planet, as it is only about 35% larger than Jupiter.
They emit less energy, so they are paleer than the sun, and their surface temperature is rather low and is approximately below 3800 (degrees) Kelvin (6380 degrees Fahrenheit / 3527 degrees Celsius).
"That's why they're reddish," Morales said.
'There is evidence of a second planet currently orbiting this star, while the third planet may have been ejected from the star system in the past, which may explain the elliptical orbit of a Jupiter-like planet,' Morales said.
Planets are formed from the same interstellar disk of gas and dust that gives birth to the star around which the planets orbit.
According to a leading model of planetary formation called the acreation model, the object is initially formed from particulate matter in the disk, and the planet's gravity force at an early stage of development allows the atmosphere to form from the surrounding gas.
This unusual system can explain a competing model called the gravitational instability model.
"In this case, the protoplanetary disk around the young star may be a little more massive than we expect and may be cold," Morales said.
This leads to impaired disk stability, and therefore some denser areas may appear.
These masses can build up until the planet collapses and is formed.
Delicatessen worker accused of giving co-workers a bean dip containing methamphetamine
The Marion County Sheriff's Office detained Cassandra Medina-Hernandez, 38, for giving co-workers a bean dip containing methamphetamine.
On Thursday, 38-year-old Cassandra Ani Medina-Hernandez, 38, from Albany, was charged with supplying methamphetamine and causing another person to consume the controlled substance - both offences being second-degree offences.
The indictment was based on the September 9 incident at the Thriftway grocery store in Jefferson.
In a statement obtained by the OregonLive.com portal under oath indicating the likelihood of guilt, the suspect's 27-year-old co-worker told Marion County sheriff's deputies that during a lunch break she saw Medina-Hernandez making a bean dip, which she then served her.
According to the a statement, the victim of the crime, who, according to what she told investigators, never took methamphetamine said that she "thought that one piece she had eaten tasted strange, but it did not arouse any suspicion."
When she returned to work, she felt that she had an upset stomach and that she could not stand on her feet.
According to the Albany Democrat-Herald newspaper, she went to a local hospital, where it was determined that the bean dip may have contained methamphetamine.
According to police reports from The Smoking Gun, another Thriftway network employee said Medina-Hernandez "told her she would add drugs to food," while another admitted that the suspect had sent her a message claiming that methamphetamine had ended up in a bean dip by accident.
OregonLive reports on a surveillance video from the deli that purportedly shows Medina-Hernandez pulling something out of his bra, standing behind a microwave and leaning back to the camera.
Then he straights up, wipes his nose, walks up to the table and puts a bean dip in a small paper dish.
According to police, the thing she pulled out of her bra was also probably on a plate.
The Oregon Stateman-Journal reports that sheriff's office officials say there are currently no suspicions that contaminated food has been given to customers.
Medina-Hernandez is in the Marion County Jail on $520,000 bail.
According to The Smoking Gun, her extensive police file indicates that the woman was already convicted of assault, robbery, identity theft, supply of methamphetamine, theft, possession of methamphetamine and possession of an illegal weapon.

"The Slovenians played very well in every element.
It's a pity to finish the sets because we had our chances, but we didn't take advantage of them.
We do not hang our heads, because on Saturday the match for the bronze medal", said the polish volleyball team's quarterback Marcin Komenda after the 1-3 defeat to Slovenia in the semi-finals of the European Championships.
The talented player appeared on the field in the second and third set.
According to some, Vital Heynen should give him a better chance to show his skills.
However, the Eagles coach focused on fabian Drzyzgi's experience.
"Everybody's Talking About Jamie": casting for the role of Jamie New in the West End

What does KAS do about the head of nik?
Renting a property for an amount below the market price – these are the reservations that arise in connection with the case of the President of the Supreme Audit Office Marian Banasia.
We asked about what the treasury is doing in this matter in the Chamber of Tax Administration in Krakow and in the Ministry of Finance.
Bertold Kittel, in a report for TVN's "SuperViewfinder", expressed doubts about the declarations of assets of the President of the Supreme Audit Office Marian Banasia.
The Central Anti-Corruption Bureau has been investigating them for several months.
The audit is due to end in the second half of October, after the general elections.
According to the statements, Banaś was to rent a tenement house of 400 square meters and two smaller apartments.
In total, he received 65,7 000 zlotys per year.
A report by "SuperViewfinder" revealed that the tenement house he rented housed the hotel for hours.
The head of nik later explained on state television why he charged only just over PLN 5,000 per month for renting a property.
Gazeta Wyborcza, citing experts in the valuation of real estate, estimated that for the tenement house itself it should be PLN 15 000 per month.
"The amount was lower for a simple reason: I entered into a preliminary agreement and it was precisely that the tenant was to buy this tenement house that caused me to agree to a lower rent, that the remaining dues would be settled when the tenement house was sold," Banaś argued.
However, doubts arose as to whether such conduct constituted an error of law.
Konrad Zawada, press officer of the Chamber of Tax Administration in Krakow, in an interview with TVN24 reported that "this matter is directly dealt with by the Ministry of Finance".
"Please address any such questions to the Minister of Finance," he added.
Zawada explained that in such cases "actions are carried out by the National Revenue Administration".
Pawel Jurek, a spokesman for the Ministry of Finance, acknowledged that the National Revenue Administration itself monitors many cases that may raise some objections.
"The National Revenue Administration operates in such a way that it has its own information and is based in a sense on information that is publicly available.
On this basis, it decides whether or not to pursue a particular case," explained a mf spokesman.
"On the other hand, because there is fiscal secrecy in all of us in the whole financial system, we never speak out because we cannot speak on individual matters of a particular taxpayer, a specific person or a particular company," he stressed when asked about the case of Marian Banasia.
Finance Minister Jerzy Kwieciński stressed that "tax authorities do not transmit such information to the public".
"It is known that the entire tax apparatus deals with a lot of similar cases across the country," he said.
Secrets of the royal family: revealed surprising guests often flying a royal plane
As part of their duties, members of the royal family must travel hundreds of journeys around the world during their lives.
This is usually facilitated by a royal aircraft – a private machine that transports the royal family around the world for important events and speeches.
It is no surprise that owning your own plane comes with privileges.
Members of the royal family do not have to stand in long queues for check-in, they do not have baggage allowances and, as it turns out, they can invite any guests on board – including really unheard of.
According to a recent Channel 5 documentary, it's not just the Queen and Prince Philip who often travel by royal plane.
During a programme entitled 'Secrets of royal flights', the former Queen's flight navigator revealed that she and the royal family often flew furry guests.
Bob Shields said: "Sometimes very important royal dogs could fly together with our very important royal guests."
It is not surprising that the Queen could have asked her beloved favorites to accompany her on her journeys, as she is known for her deep attachment to corgi dogs.
From an early age, Queen Elizabeth was a lover of these four-legged creatures, and there are arduous hearings that since her coronation she has owned more than 30 corgi.
She is said to have had five corgi in 2007: Monty, Emma, Linnet, Willow and Holly.
They were joined by five cocker spanies: Bisto, Oxo, Flash, Spick and Span, as well as four dogs that are a cross between a dachshund from a corgi: Cider, Berry Vulcan and Candy.
The crew of the royal plane certainly had their hands full.
A royal house worker was seen taking the dogs out and asking them to take care of their needs before taking them on board the plane, Shields continues.
I am pleased to say that no incident has ever occurred.
The programme also revealed the shocking amount of baggage the Queen takes with her on board as part of her travel duties.
The film's narrator stated: "In 1953, the Queen took 12 tonnes of luggage on her 70,000-kilometre journey."
To be able to portray it better, it's about the same as two huge elephants.
However, the Queen is not the only one with a soft spot for fashion.
Apparently, the Duchess of Cambridge also has her own tastes about carrying her wardrobe - it is said that each of her dresses is allocated a separate seat.
The new law enters into force.
Accident victims will receive annuities
On Friday, a regulation comes into force to ensure that survivors continue to pay their pensions, says the Financial Ombudsman.
This is the Law of 9 July 2019 on the special rights of victims in the event of exhaustion of the guarantee amount established under the provisions in force before 1 January 2006.
It concerns persons who were injured before 1 January 2006.
At that time, the guarantee amounts were significantly lower than at present, so in some cases insurers had already stopped paying annuities.
"I am pleased with this regulation, because our institution has for many years sought to create a mechanism that will provide serious victims of accidents with a guarantee of financial support from motor insurance or farmer's OC despite the exhaustion of the guarantee amount", says Aleksander Daszewski, legal counsel in the Office of the Financial Ombudsman.
According to the Financial Ombudsman, this was necessary because it is often very tragic situations concerning people in very poor health who, because of an accident, cannot work, for example, and at the same time bear significant costs of post-accident rehabilitation treatment.
Some of them no longer received compensatory pensions and for increased needs due to the need for further treatment or rehabilitation due to the exhaustion of the so-called guarantee sums on OC policies.
Some of this threatened in the coming years.
Until 1 January 2006, the insurer's liability limits were significantly lower than the current ones.
Therefore, the problem of exhaustion of the guarantee amount in previous years most often affected people who suffered damage in the 1990s.
At that time, the guarantee amounts were very low and the economic conditions resulted in an increase in prices.
"We also noted that this problem also affected a number of mostly young people who suffered harm at a time when the total amount was 350,000. for each victim of an accident.
It is currently €5.21 million per event, regardless of the number of victims.
So this is a huge difference from earlier periods, so the problem required the intervention of the legislature", recalls Aleksander Daszewski.
It explains that, since the amount of the guarantee is increased from time to time, the legislature took the view that the upper limit of the liability of the Insurance Guarantee Fund would be the amount of the guarantee in force at the time when the claim for payment of the annuity was sent to the Fund.
This rule applies if the insurance undertaking is not obliged to pay the pension on the basis of a court decision fixing a different amount of the guarantee amount than that laid down in the insurance contract oc.
This is the case where the amount of the guarantee is raised in court pursuant to Article 3571 of the Civil Code, which makes it possible to modify the existing contractual relationship.
"In recent days, we have sent letters to people who have asked us to intervene in the past.
We inform about the new powers in them and, of course, we assure about the possibility of providing further support in case of any problems", says Aleksander Daszewski.

Brenda Barattini convicted of cutting off boyfriend's penis
The case concerns the events of November 2017.
According to the Buenos Aires Times, it was brenda Barattini who learned that her boyfriend had shown his friends a sex machine that had been created in their bedroom.
The 28-year-old, who is an architect by training, explained to the court that her partner had ruined her life in this way and treated her like a "trophy" to be boasted about in front of friends.
"It violated my intimacy, my life and my career.
He destroyed everything," she argued.
A resident of Cordoba herself decided to do justice.
She invited her boyfriend, 42-year-old Sergio F. to bed and told him that she had prepared a special surprise.
Using a velvet band, she covered his eyes, then grabbed the secator and cut off his penis.
"I felt like I was going to die.
I didn't see anything.
I tried to get up, pulled up my pants and grabbed my cell phone to call an ambulance," the victim testified.
"I wanted to leave, but she started insulting me.
She grabbed me by the t-shirt and my hair without letting me go," he added.
Although Barattini explained that her boyfriend had harmed her by revealing the sextam, she did not try to escape responsibility.
"Please do justice," she said toward the jury.
She was eventually found guilty of attempted murder and sentenced to 13 years in prison.
Former Alabama Congressman Jack Edwards dies at age 91
On Friday, retired Alabama State Congressman Jack Edwards, who served a 10th term and was one of the first wave of Republicans from the so-called Deep South, died.
A family spokesman said Edwards died at his home in Fairhope after battling pancreatic cancer.
Edwards was originally elected to the U.S. Congress in 1965 as one of the first Republicans from Alabama in the Deep South because the party was gaining supporters here.
He served 10 terms in Congress.
According to a statement issued by the family in response to a recent question about what kind of world he would like to leave to his great-grandchildren and great-grandchildren, Edwards replied that he would like to return courtesy.
"I hope that my great-grandchildren and my great-grandchildren will grow up in a country where courtesy will return to the common debate and efforts to solve the country's problems," Edwards said, according to a family statement.
Alabama Governor Kay Ivey said Edwards served his state and country with the highest standards of integrity.
She added that in his honor, flags on the Alabama State Capitol would be lowered to half mast.
"He was the epitome of a true government official and was the best statesman for Alabama.
Our state has lost one of its greatest politicians," Ivey said in a statement.
Michelle Obama calls Meghan Markle an 'inspiration' on Instagram
Michelle Obama paid high praise to Meghan Markle on Instagram on Thursday, calling the Duchess of Sussex "a caring leader who breaks the patterns and makes our world better."
The Duchess and Prince Harry, currently on a ten-day royal trip to South Africa with their son Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, attended a meeting with young people earlier this week where they met with leaders of the Obama Foundation.
"I would like to thank my friend, Her Majesty, The Duchess of Sussex @sussexroyal, "a caring leader who breaks the schemes and makes our world better," the former first lady wrote in her enthusiastic post.
"Whether it's meeting with the leaders of the Obama @ObamaFoundation Foundation or helping girls around the world access the education they deserve, it inspires a lot of people," Obama added, posting a photo of a smiling Meghan posing with the foundation's leaders.
Meghan interviewed Obama for the September issue of British Vogue, a guest appearance by the former "Suits" actress.
In a candid conversation, the former first lady talked about motherhood and how it changed her.
"Being a mother means bringing the art of tempering to power," Obama said in an interview.
"Motherhood has taught me that most of the time it's my job to give children space so they can explore the world and become who they want to be.
Not who I want them to be or who I wanted to be at their age, but who they are deep down.
Obama, who knows from experience the pressure of being on a candlestick, shared her advice with the Duchess during an interview with Good Housekeeping magazine.
"The pressure you feel – imposed by yourself and others – can sometimes overwhelm you," she said.
"So my advice is to slow down and not rush in any way.
I spent my first few months in the White House mostly worrying about my daughters, making sure they were doing well at school and making new friends before I went on to work more ambitiously.
I think that's what's needed, too.
Trump's hotel retains permission to sell alcohol despite complaint about owner's disposition
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Washington alcoholic beverage control commission has rejected a request to check whether a local Trump International Hotel should lose its license to sell alcohol because of the owner's disposition.
The agency ordered on Wednesday that the complaint of three pastors, two retired judges and two rabbis is unfounded because most of them do not live in or own property in the district.
The Washington Post reports that this is the second time that these plaintiffs are seeking to revoke the hotel's permit to sell alcohol, citing a district-specific provision that applicants for a permit to sell alcohol must show a "good disposition."
The original complaint filed last summer claimed that President Donald Trump was breaking the law, and cited accusations of assault and repeated fraud.
The complaint was dismissed because the authorisation was granted before it was submitted.
The reason for the second complaint was the extension of the authorisation.
The Sun: Crushing report considers Cleveland police service scandals to be worst in UK
Inspectors found disgraced police scandals to be the worst in the UK.
In a crushing report, they rated cleveland police work as inadequate in all areas.
Phil Gormley of Her Majesty's Chief Police Inspectorate says there has been a "significant deterioration" in standards in the Cleveland police service.
New calls have emerged calling for the police service to be terminated, led by five commanders in six years.
According to the report, the police did not make efforts to prevent crime, arrest suspects and protect the most vulnerable.
Phil Gormley of Her Majesty's Chief Police Inspectorate said: "There has been a significant deterioration in standards since our last inspection."
Commander Mike Veale resigned in January after less than a year in the face of an investigation into "serious" but undisclosed allegations about his conduct.
Deputy Commander Adrian Roberts was suspended after being remanded in custody on charges of gross misconduct.
Last year, Inspector Simon Hurwood appeared before the Misconduct Commission for sexually assaulting co-workers.
He left the service.
Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen, for the Tories, said: "This is official confirmation that these services are being disgraced.
It is time for the Home Office department to intervene now."

Will the young finally wait?
Older residents are disturbed by young enthusiasts of scootering and skateboarding, while those complain that there is no suitable place for them in Oława.
For years, young people have been admonished for a place to skate, skateboard, scooter, bike.
The topic is still coming back to our benches.
We have been paying attention to this problem for 10 years.
Recently, it got loud again about the lack of a skate park.
That's why we go back to that again and ask the office what's next?
We remind you that a few days ago a woman spoke, who is disturbed by young people driving in the center.
"I am writing on behalf of the residents of the block at pl. Pilsudski, so that you can get interested in the situation of Oława youth", writes Małgorzata to the editor.
"The residents of the block called the City Guard repeatedly to no availes.
As proof of such everyday situations, I upload photos attached."
We asked others for their opinion on this.
Most unequivocally state that young people simply have nowhere to ride in the city and have been unsuccessfully demanding a place for themselves for years.
There was an avalanche of comments below the Facebook post.
Already in July we wrote that there is a chance that the skatepark was built on the Oława Town.
The mayor reported that the city had requested funding for the construction of a skate park.
"The project consulted with young people, together with the permits, is ready.
On March 28, a request was sent to the Ministry of Sport and Tourism to finance a task entitled "Construction of a Skatepark in Oława" under the Sport Polska programme", we were told at the office.
Total project value: 798 306,00 PLN.
Requested grant amount: PLN 263 440.00.
Now we have asked again at what stage is the case.
"We do not yet have any information on the application for funding submitted to the Ministry of Sport and Tourism", informs Elżbieta Bednarczyk, head of the European Funds Department of UM Oława.
"From the information received from the ministry's employees, it appears that the final selection of all tasks under the Sport Polska Programme should take place in October."
We also asked for a visualization of the Oława skate park.
We present it below.
The youth informed the editors that this Saturday (September 28) they will collect signatures under a petition for the construction of a skate park in Oława.
"The rebellious youth saw the last Post on Facebook and came to the conclusion that they would organize a fundraiser," Nicholas writes to the editor.
Signatures on the petition will be collected from 12:00 am in the lidl market area.
Polish Cup 2019/20: draw 1/16 of the final.
We know couples, hit from years ago
It was one of the fiercest rivalries in the league.
The greatest legend was the memorable match of the 1996/1997 season.
On June 18, 1997, Legia took on the team in the penultimate round at the old stadium in Łazienkowska.
Both teams shared a point.
The hosts had to win, Widzew the second consecutive Polish championship gave a point.
Up to 87. Minutes Legia led 2-0, but for five consecutive minutes there was an earthquake – Widzew scored three goals and enjoyed the title.
Over the years, the Łódź club got into more and more trouble until it ceased to count in the fight for the championship and fell from the top division.
The last time the two teams met at this level was in the 2013/2014 season.
Legia – on the way to the title – had two victories – 5:1 at home and 1–0 away.
Back to the elite
Currently, boaters are fighting for a return to the national elite.
These plans were delayed by at least a year, as in previous competitions, being one of the favorites, they failed to advance to the top flight.
As a result of this failure, the club's personnel revolution occurred in the summer.
The authorities changed, the coach Marcin Kaczmarek was eventually appointed, and in taking the next step up the club hierarchy are to help seasoned in league buoys Marcin Robak and Mateusz Możdżeń.
For now, Widzew is fourth in the League II table, but in the Polish Cup he defeated the deputy leader of the silesian wrocław league on Tuesday 2-0.
Legia in the same size played on the outing Niepołomice Forest.
Premier League clash
The only pair composed of representatives of the highest class in the 1/16 finals are its benjamin ŁKS and Górnik Zabrze.
The matches of this phase will take place from 29 to 31 October.
This year, 1/8 of the final (3-5 December) is scheduled to take place.
The final is scheduled to take place on May 2 at the National PGE in Warsaw.
Nancy Pelosi: William Barr 'revolted' and impeachment inquiry must roll its course
You never know where we're going.
Now, in my opinion, we are participating in an attempt to hide the facts of an attempt to hide the facts, and the investigation into this matter may take time," Pelosi said in an interview with CNN on Capitol Hill.
"They will do the work they started, sticking to the facts and the time necessary to find them," she added.
According to a report released this week by the White House, Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenburg to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, the 2020 nominee, and his son.
Trump also asked Zełenski to work with Barr and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, on the matter, according to the minutes.
Trump has denied that he did anything improper.
On Thursday, CNN reported that national security lawyers from the Justice Department notified a whistleblower complaint about Trump's conduct involving Ukraine more than a week before the formal filing.
After receiving a complaint as a complaint from intelligence community officials, the Justice Department concluded that Trump's phone call did not provide a criminal investigation into campaign finance.
Asked if Barr should testify, Pelosi said Friday that the Intelligence Committee will decide who to call as a witness.
However, she added that, in her view, Barr had "rebelled."
Such a condition lasts for a long time.
"After all, (Barra) mentions all of this," Pelosi added, referring to Trump's mention of his attorney general during a July conversation with the Ukrainian leader.
It is interesting that he made decisions about how to deal with the complaint.
Pelosi said she was "very afraid" of whistleblowers, whom Trump attacked on Thursday as spies, suggesting that spies had acted differently in the past.
I think the President's words go beyond i responsibility, it's dangerous.
Our whistleblowers play an important role in uncovering - exposing wrongdoing in our government," Pelosi said, adding, "The President's words about people who can provide whistleblower information seriously undermine honesty in government."
On Tuesday, Pelosi took the historic step of announcing a formal investigation into the illegal act based on allegations of trying to pressure the leader of a foreign state for political gain.
The phone call was included in a complaint published Thursday in which a whistleblower claimed that Trump had abused his authority to "induce Ukraine to interfere" in the upcoming 2020 election.
The whistleblower also alleged that White House lawyers ordered officials to remove the transcript of the conversation from the computer system where it is stored for Council of Ministers officials and put it in a system designed for sensitive information.

Possible driving ban for speeding for Crystal Palace striker Christian Benteke

The Crystal Palace striker, 28, pleaded guilty to driving a Bentley car at 80mph in a 50mph area on the A3 road in Richmond, south-west London on 20 January.
Then, in March, speed cameras in Putney, south-west London, recorded a Belgian driving at 89mph, twice the 40mph limit.
Benteke, of Kingston Hill, Surrey, did not have to appear at Lavender Hill Magistrates' Court this morning.
He pleaded guilty to both offences in early July under a simplified procedure under which lighter offences are judged at a meeting held by a single magistrate.

Ghana: Kofi Manu concerned about Verification Commission structure
Kofi Manu, football manager and representative of Sekondi Hasaacas, raised doubts about the composition of the Verification Commission for the upcoming elections to the Ghana National Football Association (GFA).
He questioned the inclusion of The President of the Commission, Frank Davies, adding that he was not satisfied with his participation.
In an interview with GNA Sport, Manu expressed doubts about whether the President of the Commission would be honest, as the outcome of the verification process is in his interest.
The Verification Committee should be composed of neutral external persons who have no links with any of the members and who have not previously shown interest.
For example, Davies hired NC as a lawyer who wrote to Osei Kwaku Palmer for a 10 percent payment.
He is also a well-known supporter of the Olympic Games.
For these two reasons, he should not be allowed to take a position on the Verification Committee because he has an interest in doing so," he argued.
Manu stated that if Fred Pappoe, Director of the Olympic Games, were to appear before the Commission, there would be a conflict of interest on the part of the President because of his links to the club, while suggesting that if Palmer was to stand before the Commission, he would be subject to prejudice and bias.
As expected, members of the Commission were due to start work from yesterday, after being sworn in at a ceremony at the GFA Secretariat in Accra on Tuesday, 19 September, and to conclude on 4 October.
The President of the Commission is Frank Davies, and its members are Corporate Governance Consultant and Lawyer Marian Barnor and Mr Emmanuel Darkwah.
Other members include Reginald Laryea, Director of Marketing and Business, and Richard Akpokavie, Sports Administrator and Lawyer.

Israel: No agreement on unity government
Israel's two main parties, the Blue-White Alliance and Likud, continued negotiations on Friday on the establishment of a unity government.
The meeting, which took place after the president entrusted a mission to form a government with Benjamin Netanyahu, did not produce results.
The talks considered the possibility of rotating the leadership of both parties in the government and netanyahu's stay as prime minister, but, as the Israeli daily Haarec writes, there was no rapprochement of views.
Talks will resume on Sunday.
The centrist Blue-White Alliance said in a press release that it had made preliminary demands.
He accuses the right-wing Likud of "emaciating himself in his positions", demanding that his leader and former prime minister, Netanyahu, remain at the head of the government and that the cabinet was previously composed of ultra-Orthodox politicians.
"From the outset, it was known that the Blue and Whites would not agree to these conditions," the message reads.
Likud, acting solely in Netanyahu's interest, wants to "bring about a second round of elections in Israel."
Blue and White leader Benny Gantz refuses to endorse netanyahu's government as long as he is charged with involvement in three corruption scandals under which prosecutors could formally indict him after wednesday's meeting.
"Likud and the Blue and Whites won a sufficient majority in the elections on 17th September to allow them to ceasing joint rule as natural allies, but this forces them to negotiate what neither side wanted," writes the EFE agency.
President Reuwen Riwlin has sought to bring their positions closer in recent days and has proposed the establishment of a "rotating government", suggesting that the Prime Minister temporarily suspend his posts, which would allow Gantz to take up the post if the accusations against Netanyahu were upheld and formalised.
There is no shortage of Israeli analysts who believe that things are stuck in a dead end.
However, half of Israelis, according to a poll published on Friday by public television, want to unlock the political situation in the country by forming a unity government under the rotating leadership of alternate netanyahu and Ghant.
50.6% are in favour. Israelis, 32.1% of those surveyed oppose such a solution.
The poll shows a deep divide in Israeli society - when asked who should be the first to lead the cabinet, 41.8% of respondents are in favour of Netanyahu and 40% are in favour of Gantz.
In another poll published by the newspaper Israel Hajom, the percentage of supporters of the unity government rises to 63%, 60% are against the new elections, which would be the third this year.
In early parliamentary elections on September 17, he won the Gantza Alliance, winning 33 seats in the 120-seat Knesset, Likud Netanyahu won 32 seats.
Netanyahu, with his traditional and potential allies, can count on the support of 55 Members, while Gantz can count on 54.
None of the parties collected the 61 seats needed to win a majority.
Tipuric calls for fight ahead of final game against Australians
Justin Tipuric says it's "time to test ourself" as Wales face a World Cup final against Australia that could shape their fate in the tournament.
Wales' victory over the Kangaroos would put the team as favourites to win Group D and secure a place in a likely quarter-final clash with France or Argentina.
But if Australia beat Wales for the 14th time. In the last 15 matches, Tipuric and his team will be immediately sent off against England in the eighth round.
"Let's be clear, both teams want to try to get through this and be at the forefront of the group," said Welsh rwacz Tipuric.
There have been some tough results in the past, but last autumn it was nice to win against them (Australia).
I think they will try impatiently to take away this victory from us, and we want to win it again.
Before we came here, you knew it was going to be a big fight.
And now we're here, and it's really time to test ourself.
Wales have won only one win over Australia, New Zealand or South Africa in World Cup history - 32 years ago in a match for third place when they defeated the Kangaroos.
And their overall record under head coach Warren Gatland shows only seven wins in 41 attempts to defeat three heavyweights from the southern hemisphere.
Wales halted a string of 13 Losing Test matches at the hands of Australia last November, and Tipuric prepared to be among those few survivors of that 9-6 win who will run out to tokyo stadium on Sunday.
When asked if the team had experienced a mental blockade before this win, Tipuric added: "It's hard to say.
These matches are so even that it can... people expect that there will be a certain mental blockade, I do not know.
At the end of the day, we probably left about 15 points on the field in the last game, so the final result looks like a much smaller advantage than it actually was.
If Wales triumph, tipurica's battle with the much-loved Australian third-line duo Michael Hooper and David Pocock during stoppage and down will be crucial.
Tipuric has played 67 games for the national team and has met with both players on several previous occasions, so he knows exactly what awaits him.
"They're players who are ranked seventh absolutely world class," he said.
When you play against world-class third-line players, you always know there's going to be a tough match to play.
These two are constantly playing against the best players in the world.
You know what gameplay you can expect.
Pocock is one of the best defensive players in the world, and Michael is a more attacking seven and probably feels better about rugby because he's always in the right place at the right time.
It is better to play against the best players in the world and challenge yourself than to face the third line of the mill, which is not so good.
It is worth playing against the best, and struggling with these two, you definitely need to be in peak form.
I wouldn't say there will be almost a cup final on Sunday, but for us it's an important match in this World Cup.
Momentum is an essential element of it.
When we build strength and constantly put in a lot of effort, we will fly like on the wings and it will be hard to beat us.

Can crime unite more than national identity?
In your hands we are not giving another book on the subject of war or military.
We are giving a deep international study on the participation of non-Germans in the Waffen-SS.
Historians from different European countries analyse the attitudes and motivations of volunteers, remind them of their activities and look at recruitment processes at different stages of the war.
Were the Danish troops different from the French?
Where did Ukrainian enthusiasm come from?
Why did we not manage to create a branch composed of Poles themselves?
What does the official historical narrative of cooperation in individual European countries look like today?
What happened to the volunteers after the war?
Among other things, these questions are answered by the book "Waffen-SS" based on solid research material.
We sought to present a subtler and more balanced, closer-to-truth picture of collaboration in Europe during The Second World War, also trying to break the methodological boundaries of historiography and a given period of history by presenting dissertations by researchers from different countries. (...) While the fate of the main victims of this war - forced laborers, Jews, prisoners, political opponents of Nazi Germany, the Slavic population - is sometimes presented in comparative and/or supranational terms, the perpetrators are examined in principle from a national perspective (if any).
'Total panic' as White House struggles to find arguments on impeachment
White House officials are waiving to figure out how to fend off thursday's renewed impeachment pressure, and one interviewee familiar with the situation describes the sense of "total panic" felt last week due to the lack of a plan to respond to the new reality.
This seems to increase "anxiety, uncertainty and concern" - one white house insider describes the mood in the West Wing - that the whistleblower's allegations could seriously harm the president and those around him.
The person said, "There's not much certainty that there's nothing hidden there."
White House officials were still unsure how to proceed, not only because there is no obvious plan of action in such a situation, but also because the allegations are so serious that the president's standard methods of effectively avoiding controversy in the past may not work. "It doesn't look like anything that's going to pass with the next series of news headlines," she joked.
Another person familiar with the discussion described the atmosphere in the White House as a "state of shock", accompanied by growing distrust that with a pro-proliging impeachment investigation, the likelihood that the president will respond irresponsibly and become "difficult to control" increases.
This concern is shared by another interlocutor claiming that those around the president anticipate that he will exhibit more "spirited" behavior, and the pressure on him will certainly begin to increase with each day of the impeachment investigation.
This raises concerns that Trump may be presenting increasingly unpredictable behavior and exploding in unexpected ways – a concern for both the presidency and the election in the context of the election year.
Facing the biggest threat to date in the presidency, Trump went from attack to defense, again reaching for a strategy he described as effective during Robert Mueller's Russia investigation.
He tried to downplay his own request to the Ukrainian president for help with the investigation of his political rivals in order to distract attention and direct it to the actions of Democrat and Democratic candidate Joe Biden, and to discredit the informant as being driven by party motives.
But while many people in the White House are seasoned after mueller's investigation, something has changed this time, said advisers and consultants.
The president, whose hallmark is strength, showed wednesday's press conference as defeated, said one person familiar with the situation.
While Trump enthusiastically received questions about the Russian investigation, he did not seem to want to answer questions about Ukraine, they said.
Some of the president's allies believe that harm can be avoided, and some of them stick to the fact that the informant had no first-hand knowledge of the controversial phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zełenski - which they say undermines his credibility.
And as is often the case when the president is under attack, this fact is vividly raised by his core supporters in his defense.
But one Republican strategist associated with the White House points out that the polls of support for the president are sky-high, and that impeachment won't affect new supporters too much.
"There is no positive in the need to focus on the president's impeachment over the next four months," especially if it hinders his legislative agenda and prevails in the new news headline cycle.
Another interlocutor says that those who maintained that impeachment would help the president did not fully understand how unpredictable his reaction would be.
Troubled White House officials sought help from advisers, completing an impeachment response team.
According to a person with knowledge of the plans, given that these efforts are at an early stage, it remains unclear whether any command centre-style initiative will be undertaken and what form it can take.
The person said there was a perception that a coordinated legal and communication strategy was required with a strong leader capable of conducting a PR attack, a riposte to the publication of a scathing whistleblower report, aimed at halting the momentum of Democrats' efforts to impeachment by disclosing the report.
A caller familiar with the situation maintains that the lack of a long-term strategic vision was clearly evident when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin declared that they had no intention of disclosed a memo describing Trump's conversation with the Ukrainian president, and then 48 hours later it was felt that there was no way out and a document had to be published.
The pressure is now expected to be greater than during the investigation of Robert Mueller, who mostly remained silent and spoke only through accusations. One person who may be involved in developing a response to the impeachment is Corey Lewandowski, a man from Trump's dirty work and a former chief of the electoral staff, said a person connected to the case.
However, Lewandowski said in an interview with NBC News that it is not true to suggest that he will direct this action.
"Over the last five years, I've done everything I could to support the president and his agenda," he said, "but I haven't had any conversations with the president or his team about joining the team to repel the false narrative of impeachment."
Donald Trump's private attorney in the Mueller investigation, Jay Sekulow, also remains involved in impeachment efforts.
"We're responding to things as well as we should," Sekulow replied when asked by NBC News for comment.
Today, the White House feels a lack of a lawyer experienced in impeachment, after Emmet Flood, who worked on Clinton's impeachment and advised the White House at the end of Mueller's investigation, has left, and the current adviser, Pat Cipollone, has no such experience.
A caller familiar with the White House strategy stated that, in general, officials at no time planned to involve people or create a command center, but acknowledged the need for a coordinated, common response and a person who could lead a political fight.

Devin Nunes accuses Democrats of demanding 'nude photos of Trump'
Congressman Devin Nunes of California apparently can't stand the bare truth that an investigation is underway into President Donald Trump.
In his thursday defense, the president accused Democrats of wanting to get nude photos of the president.
Nunes, a high-ranking Republican on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, made the allegation during a preliminary statement during a hearing following a whistleblower's complaint that Trump had asked Ukraine for help in launching an investigation into Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son.
The congressman called the Ukrainian scandal a "grotesque depiction" of the left and their "media ace", before concluding that Democrats wanted to see pictures of the president in a negligee.
"The Democrats on this committee were negotiating with people who they thought were Ukrainians to get nude photos of Trump," Nunes said.
"People can rightly ask why Democrats are so determined to indict the president when they have their chance in a year's time.
When Nunes finished giving a reprimand, HuffPost political reporter Jennifer Bendery decided to see if Democrats were really trying it... Discover.
So far, only Connecticut Representative Jim Himes has responded, though we suspect his answer is naked truth, confirming the thoughts of many of his colleagues.
The Mediaite.com suspects that Nunes' comments about nudity referred to "some more lascivious and anecdotal information" that is likely to appear in Steele's controversial files.
It is a notorious collection of allegations against Trump collected by former British spy Christopher Steele, indicating the likelihood of a tape that reportedly shows him watching prostitutes urinating in a Moscow hotel room.
Potential research into renewable biofuels could help reduce emissions
While electric cars and Semi-Diesel have dominated news outlets in recent years, one issue seems to be evicating renewable energy – airplanes.
However, a professor at the University of Alberta has developed a technology that allows renewable biofuels to be used as aviation fuel.
Dr. David Bressler is a professor at the University of Alberta in the Department of Agriculture, Life Sciences and the Environment who started working on this project in 2003.
His lab develops hydrocarbon fuel derived from fat waste, such as restaurant fat, animal fats and rapeseed oil.
Unlike ethanol and other biofuels, this technology can use lower quality oils during production, with an estimated 85% lower carbon emissions than petroleum fuels, and waste from other industries being used in the process.
This technology is designed to imitate hydrocarbons present in petroleum fuels.
"What our technology has done in the first generation," Bressler said, "is [total] the creation of hydrocarbons, which are identical molecules to diesel fuel."
While this opens up a new possibility for the use of biofuel, previously developed biofuel products tended to destabilise at lower temperatures, which in the case of aircraft flying at high altitudes posed a serious risk.
"The problem with aviation fuel is a bit of a vicious circle," Bressler said.
It is actually less worth it than diesel, but has higher requirements.
Bressler's laboratory is currently looking at two options for producing aviation biofuel.
The first option is a low-risk approach that requires additional treatment of hydrocarbon biofuel and the addition of hydrogen.
The second option is to continue working on partially developed chemical properties that will provide stability to the fuel, even at low temperatures.
"We can experiment with the chemical properties in our reactor to try to change them a little bit," Bressler said, commenting on the second option.
This option is risky.
A chipping company set up by the University of Alberta, Forge Hydrocarbons, is working to commercialize the product as airlines, as well as the Canadian and American armies, increase investment in the renewable option.
"They are able to imagine a time when the situation could be reversed and a carbon tax would be imposed on them," he said.
Instead, they want an alternative that will provide a contingency plan.
Forge currently operates a pilot facility near the Edmonton Waste Management Center and recently received $4 million from Lockheed Martin as part of an investment to support the $25 million construction of a production facility in Sombra, Ontario.
The plant is expected to produce around 19 million litres of biofuel per year.
Bressler also notes that the projected carbon reduction will be around 85 percent, but issues such as transportation and fuel production are holding back further coal reductions.
"As a technology specialist," Bressler said, "
I have the task of developing options that enable informed decisions and many choices."
ZAMOŚĆ: Another scam on granddaughter
8,000 pln and 750 euros lost a resident of Zamość thinking that she was helping her grandson, who caused the accident.
The son of a deceived zamościanka informed the police about the incident on Thursday.
"A man claiming to be her grandson called the woman on Wednesday.
He said he caused the accident and needed money.
Otherwise he will go to prison.
A senior woman wanting to help her grandson donated 8 thousand. and 750 euros to the fake policeman who came to her house", reports asp. Dorota Krukowska-Bubio from the Zamoza police.
Police officers are looking for the culprit and are once again urging caution:
"Every phone call asking for financial assistance needs to be verified.
Do not act under the influence of emotions and in a hurry.
Let us remember that police officers do not ask for money and do not accept money.
If we receive a phone call asking for financial support that will arouse our suspicions please respond immediately and notify the Police by calling the emergency number 112.
We also appeal to younger family members.
Let's talk to our seniors about threats, let's let's let's tell you how fraudsters work.
Let's ask for caution and not trusting people who call and ask for a loan."
Allies of Prime Minister Boris Johnson warn that if Brexit is reversed, the UK will be threatened by RIOTS such as in Los Angeles, and he himself is calling for calm
One of the cabinet's chief ministers said last night that the country was in danger of a "violent social upheav" if the original result was challenged by the outcome of a second referendum.
Allies of the British Prime Minister from his immediate entourage have warned that the country is threatened by civil unrest on the scale of the "yellow vests" protests in France due to social inequality and the 1992 Los Angeles riots.
Johnson called for "calming the mood" during a heated argument over the language of politics, but stressed that he would not stop using the word "surrender."
Despite his calls for calm, the Cabinet Minister told The Times: "There have never been protests like the "gilets jaunes" ("yellow vests") demonstrations or the 1992 Los Angeles riots.
People think it's impossible, just because it didn't happen before.
Now they have an example – gilets jaunes – they use encrypted phones through which they can coordinate pickets, and to push people to protest is enough for a few unsaid populist leaders.
Riots in Los Angeles erupted after a jury acquitted four white police officers who beat up black taxi driver Rodney King in 1992.
This year, anti-government demonstrators in France wearing yellow reflective vests - gilet jaunes - have been ravageing and devastating the streets of Paris for more than six weeks.
The Minister referred to Johnson's warning in the House of Commons and said that if the UK fails to leave the EU, there will be a "catastrophic loss of confidence in our political system."
"If we hold a referendum in which 30 million people vote and 66% of them are in favour of Britain remaining in the European Union, ten million citizens will remain dissatisfied," the minister said.
Even if 99% of them ignore this result, we will still have 100,000 angry people who will write to their MEMBER and who will not forgive.
Many do not need to soon see on the street tens of thousands of people.
One of the cabinet's chief ministers added that the country was in danger of a "violent social upheav" if the outcome of the first referendum was challenged by the outcome of the second.
Johnson called for a general election in which voters would decide the fate of Brexit.
The Prime Minister is reportedly facing the risk of a cabinet revolt seeking to lower demands for Brexit and reach a compromise agreement with the EU.
Hołownia, Czubówna and Krosny delighted in Krakow.
Behind us Talk'N"Roll
More than 300 participants listened on Thursday (September 26) to 11 inspiring speeches by speakers, including m.in. Szymon Hołownia, Krystyna Czubówna and Ireneusz Krosny.
This is all part of the Talk'N'Roll conference, which took place in Krakow for the fifth time.
Talk'N'roll 2019
Broadening horizons, talking about ideas worthy of publicity and joint discussions that can give impetus to further development.
This goal was set before the organizers of the Talk'N'Roll conference, inviting 11 exceptional speakers, representing very diverse industries and areas of interest, among them, among others, people known from the media - Szymon Hołownia, Krystyna Czubówna and Ireneusz Krosny.
The motto of this year's Talk'N'Roll was "Crafting the future, NOW", and it was around creating the future that the speeches of the guests invited to the conference focused.
The first session was opened by Sabre Polska managing director Sebastian Drzewiecki, who talked about how the brand that is being built around us can affect our future.
Richard Lucas took to the stage to change the audience's perception of the phenomenon of rejection, arguing that it should be accepted if he wanted to create a future, while Chris Badura took up the subject of empathy in an era of rapid technological development.
Paula Mascarenhas (VP Sabre) shared insights and techniques that can help manage your career and increase overall satisfaction by finding the right work-life balance.
The second part of the conference was opened by a multi-threaded conversation with Krystyna Czubówna, who told, among other things, about how from her perspective over the years the profession of teacher in Poland has changed.
The holder of one of the most popular voices in the country admitted that – thanks to the development of technology – today everyone can work in this profession.
However, he does not think that in the coming years a person in the position of teacher will be completely replaced by technology.
Immediately after that, Piotr Nabielec took up the problem of life in times of information overload, emotional overload or overload in terms of choice, giving the audience valuable tips on how to deal with it, and Łukasz Łętocha in his speech talked about what the next industrial revolution, known as "Industry 4.0", could lead to.
Playing teaches, teaching fun
The organizers of the conference also took care of the artistic experience, inviting the illusionist Daniel Jedynak to the stage.
The third part of the conference was opened by Irenaeus Krosny, who first entertained the audience with pantonimes and then , on the example of his own career, talked about how he was trying to maintain the right balance between his career on stage and his private life.
Szymon Hołownia also kidnapped the participants with his speech, highlighting above all the role of time in our lives.
The publicist pointed out that even two minutes can radically change the situation and you need to be ready to use this time.
In addition, Holownia shared his thoughts on the reality around us, while recalling anecdotes that could bring a smile to the faces of the audience.
Adrian Tworuszka then appeared on stage, reviewing the history and goals of several innovation models and referred them to how they are used today.
In conclusion, Marcin Słowiak, on the example of the Rubik's cube, told about the approach to problem solving.
Each of the 11 speakers certainly brought something new to the perception of reality of all who had the opportunity to watch the performances, and the lively reactions and numerous questions to the guests testify to the great commitment of the audience.
The organizers provided a broadcast for all those who were personally unable to attend the event, and recordings of the lecture are available on the website.
Rule of law instead of the rule of law.
"Despite not having enough votes to amend the Constitution, the ruling majority has made a number of changes to the state system, posing threats to the protection of the rule of law and the principle of power-giving," writes the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights in a report published on Thursday.
The report "Rule of law instead of the rule of law" documents, among other things, changes in the justice system and in the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms.
The Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights (HFPC) published a report on Thursday entitled "Rule of law instead of the rule of law.
Threats to the protection of human rights in Poland in 2015-2019".
The Foundation estimates in the report that in 2015-2019 there was the greatest decline in the protection of human rights in Poland after 1989.
"Despite not having enough votes to amend the Constitution, the ruling majority has made a number of changes to the state system, posing threats to the protection of the rule of law and the principle of power-distribution.
By adapting the law to political objectives, the rule of law has been replaced by the rule of law," the HFPC experts write.
What's in the HFPC report?
The report documents changes in the functioning of the justice system, independent institutions (such as the public media and the Ombudsman) and in the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms (including freedom of assembly, women's rights, LGBT rights and the right to a fair trial).
The report also summarises the dispute between the Polish authorities and the European Union, which has been ongoing for three years.
"In the last four years, for the first time and on this scale, we have seen the exercise of the right to pursue particular party interests.
This has translated into an ongoing crisis of the rule of law, as well as a weakening of the entire human rights system in Poland,"stressed lawyer Marcin Wolny, one of the authors of the report.
Protection of human rights
As the report points out, the last four years have been a "period of systemic change in both the state" and "in the protection of human rights".
Over the past four years, the Sejm has adopted more than 20 key pieces of legislation for the protection of human rights.
"Changes were often adopted at a hasty pace, without public consultation and despite objections from legal circles, the Ombudsman or international organisations," explained lawyer Małgorzata Szuleka, co-author of the report.
According to the report, the main trends observed over the last four years are: "weakening independent institutions (including courts and public prosecutors), not respecting binding court judgments and recommendations of international institutions, and weakening guarantees of protection of human rights".
State authorities did not respond
The Helsinki Foundation for Human Affairs found "situations in which state authorities have not responded or explicitly disregarded emerging cases of aggression".
The foundation's experts noted that some of the changes were made in an atmosphere of attacks on individual institutions or professional groups or groups exposed to discrimination.
The Foundation points out that the result of state activity in the field of limiting the rule of law is the ongoing dispute between the Polish authorities and the European Union, as well as a number of recommendations from international law actors.
"The failure to implement these recommendations not only weakens Poland's position as a leader in democratic transition in the Central and Eastern Europe region, but also exposes the Polish state to liability for violations of European Union law or the European Convention on Human Rights," the report reads.
Brother of Pakistani social media star sentenced to life in prison for honor killing
Women's rights experts say that justice is often difficult due to protracted proceedings, the release of suspected killers on bail and the blurring of cases in the public consciousness.
"It takes so long that people forget," says Farzana Bari, a women's rights activist and founder of Pakistan's first gender studies department at the university, adding that even the widely publicized baloch murder case has been settled for more than three years.
Although reliable data is difficult to establish, according to women's rights groups, the Pakistan Human Rights Commission found at least 300 cases of so-called honour killings in 2018.
Many activists say the actual number is much higher, and the honorable crime awareness network estimates that there are about a fifth of the 5,000 honor killings committed worldwide each year in Pakistan.
Record earnings of Poles abroad
However, remittances to the country are decreasing, because many emigrants settle outside Poland permanently – reports Friday's "Rzeczpospolita".
According to the latest euro-tax report, the average earnings of Poles working in other European countries amounted to more than 8.6 thousand in 2018. pln, which means that they have increased by almost a thousand zlotys, or almost 12%.
Euro-Tax "estimates that the total income of Polish expatriates earning in eu countries reached a record value of PLN 154.5 billion in 2018, one seventh more than the year before," it reads.
Pawel Kaczmarczyk, director of the Centre for Migration Research at the University of Warsaw, says that Poles are doing better in the international labour market, where they use the various options available.
"There is also a growing number of professionals and professionals who are moving from country to country in search of better conditions, as are employees of international corporations," the newspaper reports.
Some Euro-Tax customers work in two countries during the year, e.g. the UK and Germany.
"It is in West Germany in 2018 that the total earnings of Polish expatriates increased by 11% (to nearly PLN 27 billion).
However, poles in the Islands earned the most – almost PLN 35 billion," it continues.
The President of Euro-Tax believes that despite the improvement of working conditions on the Polish market, the number of economic migrants is not decreasing.
Indeed, still saxons in the West and North of Europe (led by Norway) are often a chance of several times higher wages than in Poland.
"Even with the minimum rates in a given country, which in Germany, for example, are 9.5-11.7 euros per hour," the daily reports.
"Rzeczpospolita" reports that Poles stay not only because of higher wages, but also because they settled abroad.
Many Poles have roots abroad, as can also be seen from the dwindling remittances to the country.
Last year's ones were the lowest in years.
As the economist Tadeusz Chrościcki reminds us, as the period of stay abroad increases, the group of people transferring money to the country decreases and their amount decreases.
"Emigrants bring their loved ones together," reads Friday's "Rzeczpospolita".
Protracted monsoons cause floods and chaos in many regions of India
The monsoon season in India is already prolonged by almost a month, and unprecedented rainfall is causing death as a result of falling buildings and rotting many crops.
The monsoon usually gives way in northern India in early September, but the average rainfall this month has exceeded the norm by 37%.
According to experts from the Indian Meteorological Department, if this situation continues for the next few days, it will be the latest ending monsoon in decades.
In many parts of the country, rainfall is still unheard of – recently, in the western Indian city of Pune, Wednesday and Thursday's heavy rains led to the deaths of more than a dozen people and havoc due to the collapse of buildings.
There was flooding of houses, people waded through the streets in water on their knees, which normally occurs only during the apogee of the monsoon.
Heavy rainfall has also occurred in cities such as Kolkata, Lucknow and Hyderabad.
As a result of prolonged rains in the northern state of Uttarakhand, many houses were destroyed.
The monsoon also began late.
Many areas lacked water, so farmers were preparing for a likely drought.
Too long a monsoon is not welcomed by farmers.
Such a amount of rain is not normal at this time of year.
"Through it, my vegetables – and Now I have cabbage, beans, peas and tomatoes – will rot," says Prakash Mehra, a farmer from a small farm in Bhimtal, Uttarakhand state.
For consumers, the impact of the delayed, as well as late-ending monsoon means an increase in the price of onions, which is an indispensable component of Indian dishes.
Onions, which usually had to pay 20 rupees (0.23 British pounds), now cost 80 rupees (about 1 British pound) per kilogram in cities like Delhi and Mumbai.
Festivals and festivals are also at risk.
Another big festival is the Dasar festival on October 8, during which Indians erect huge puppets like a comic book depicting Arava, a character with a lush mustache and a sinister smile from the epic "Ramayana".
Burning Ravana symbolizes the triumph of good over evil.
However, given that Ravana's likenesses are made of paper, if the monsoon continues, it is Ravana who will laugh the last.

Doodle celebrates Google's 21st birthday
It would be hard to imagine a world without Google today.
In the search engine we look for answers to all the questions that torment us.
What are we looking for on Google?
"What is it?", "Where?", "How?" and "How much?" are some of the favorite categories searched for by Poles.
According to the data giant, last year we were happy to ask m.in. about "Where's the storm?", "How to make asparagus?" and "How many fingers does a horse have?", "How to get rid of fruit midges?", "How to eat kaki?".
Today, the search engine celebrates its 21st birthday.
Its users – and in Poland as many as 96% of people use "Google's injuit" – today welcomes a special Google Doodle.
This time it is not animated.
Google reminds you of your birthday by showing you a desktop computer with a monitor, mouse and keyboard, and a digital date printed in the lower right corner – as in the 1990s photo.
Cataloguing information
The search engine was created for a specific purpose – to catalog all possible information and share it via the Internet.
Its name is a word game.
It comes from the mathematical term googol meaning ten raised to the hundredth power.
The name was also intended to reflect the company's intention to induce as many pages as possible from the world's internet resources.
Google Search was founded by Sergey Brin and Larry Page in 1996 as part of their student project at Stanford University.
It was based on a mathematical analysis of the relationship between the parties, which worked better than the methods of simply sorting the results based on the frequency of the occurrence of a given phrase.
At first, the search engine was called BlackRub, referring to the English word blacklink, which means the number of pages linking to a given result.
Page and Brin founded a company called Google Inc. On September 7, 1998, and not long after, they launched the famous google.com.
What's next, Google?
In December 1998, "PC Magazine" reports that Google's search results are extremely relevant.
Then the history of the company looks almost like a fairy tale - rapid development with each month, conquering more markets and increasing the value of the company.
As early as June 2000, Google's URL index has more than a billion entries, making Page and Brin the world's largest search engine.
Currently, the company founded by Page and Brin is one of the leading players in the IT market.
So is there any room for development?
"Google's mission is to organize global information resources to make them widely available and useful, even though we have made great progress in this area, there is still a very long way to go to achieve this goal," Piotr Zalewski of Google Polska assured Newsweek.
Frequent contact with pesticides may increase the risk of heart disease and stroke
A new study suggests that working with exposure to plant protection products at high concentrations may result in a high risk of heart disease later in life.
This was the case for a group of Americans of Japanese descent in Hawaii who had been studied for more than 30 years.
Researchers found that compared to men who did not work with plant protection products, those who had the most contact with them were 45% more likely to have heart disease or stroke.
'This study highlights the need to use personal protective equipment while in contact with pesticides at work and the importance of recording contact with such products at work in medical records, as well as controlling for standard factors that increase the incidence of heart disease,' said study co-author Dr Beatriz Rodriguez.
She is a professor of geriatric medicine at the University of Hawaii in the Manoa district.
The results were based on data on more than 6,000 men on Oahu Island who participated in the Kuakini Honolulu cardiac program.
As the researchers pointed out, the results of the study may not apply to women and other populations because it only affected men of Japanese descent.
Pesticides have a long half-life, so the effects of their effects on health can make themselves known many years after contact with these substances.
In this case, the most visible results were observed within 10 years after contact with plant protection substances.
In a press release, Rodriguez said that "after 34 years of observing men, it turned out that the relationship between exposure to pesticides and heart disease and stroke was no longer significant."
This was probably because ageing factors were more important, masking possible cause-and-effect relationships between exposure to pesticides and incidence of cardiovascular disease later in life.
Researchers did not discover a significant relationship between exposure to small to moderate amounts of plant protection products and an increased risk of heart disease or stroke.
Zelenski-Trump phone call: Poroshenko adds his three cents
Washington politics has had a tumultuous week with impeachment proceedings against US President Donald Trump
Getting embroiled in a political scandal is a situation for political rookie Volodymyr Zełenski that he would rather avoid.
But what do we really know about the Zelenski-Trump affair and will it have far-reaching consequences for the first one?
Almost at the start of the phone call, Trump told Zełensk that the United States was doing more for Ukraine than European countries.
Despite the fact that the notes revealed by the White House are not complete, they detail Trump's attack on German Chancellor Angela Merkel for engaging with other Leaders of European countries instead of making concrete proposals.
The controversy was sparked by zełenski's response, which stated that he agrees with Trump not 100%, but 1000%.
Zelenski added that both French President Macron and Merkel are not sufficiently trying to help Ukraine.
This exchange of views led politicians, especially those from the Ukrainian opposition, to choose to speak out via social media.
Petro Poroshenko, ukraine's former president, said on Twitter that the EU's support "was unprecedented."
In other tweets, Poroshenko said he was grateful for the EU's support during the "Russian aggression", which included sanctions and financial assistance.
Others expressed their concerns m.in Ukrainian politician Victoria Voytsitska said: "How can we talk to Germany and France now?"
Trump then mentioned military aid and asked Zełenski to investigate not one, but two cases: the first concerning Joe Biden's son Hunter and the other related to the hacking of a DNC server, suggesting that Ukraine was involved in a hacking attack on Democrats' email inboxes during the 2016 election.
It is not known whether this will spoil European relations or break relations with the French and German leaders.
I don't want to talk badly about anyone...
Thank you to all those who helped us," zełenski said after the publication of the transcript of zełenski's phone call in New York at the UN General Assembly.
Zełenski is due to meet the leaders of Russia, Germany and France at the upcoming "Normandy Four" summit, which is due to take place in October.
Former provincial inspector finally acquitted
The court cleared Jerzy Wiśniewski of the alleged acts.
After 6 years, Jerzy Wiśniewski was finally cleared of the charges.
The District Court in Przemyśl cleared Jerzy Wiśniewski, former head of the Regional Inspectorate of Commercial Quality of Agri-Food Products in Rzeszów, of an allegation of exceeding the powers.
The Lublin prosecutor's office alleged that he had betrayed the then marshal of the province to the date of inspection at the food oil production plant.
A final acquittal has recently been reached in this case.
The appeal was heard on September 12.
"The court upheld the acquittal under appeal," confirms Judge Małgorzata Reizer, spokesman for the Przemyśl District Court.
This is a judgment of 14 February this year handed down by the District Court in Przemyśl.
Jerzy Wisniewski commented on Facebook at the time: "It has been six years since the Public Prosecutor's Office in Lublin presented me with a charge of alleged breaking the law in a telephone conversation with the Marshal of the Podkarpackie Region on 30 April 2012.
The court unequivocally stated that I was innocent and did not break the applicable law at the time.
I was convinced that my phone call at the time with the Marshal of the Podkarpackie Region was in accordance with the applicable law.
The version of events made public by the media outlined in 2013 by the Public Prosecutor's Office in Lublin was not true and caused irreparable damage both to the food manufacturer's entrepreneur and to the loss of my image to my employers, employees and the local community.
The indictment drawn up against me in the General Court's opinion contained a number of errors, false facts, unreliable determinations of the legal basis, not actually confirmed events.
With the help of cba in Rzeszów, everything was done to eliminate me from public and professional life.
I was immediately fired from my job and deprived of funds.
I have been dependent on my wife for a long time."
Recall.
Jerzy Wisniewski served as the provincial inspector of the commercial quality of agri-food products from 2009 to 2013.
He was dismissed from office after the Public Prosecutor's Office in Lublin presented him with charges in 2013.
According to investigators, in a telephone interview he had betrayed the then marshal of the province (Mirosław Karapyta was sentenced to 4 years imprisonment) the date of inspection at the food oil production plant belonging to the wife of the then Deputy Marshal of Podkarpackie.
This warning – as prosecutors in Lublin claimed – was intended to make the owner of the company aware of the inspection and correct the labels on oils that were incomplete.
Jerzy Wiśniewski heard allegations of abuse of power, for which he was threatened with up to 3 years in prison.
"I am relieved that this case has finally come to an end and the court has confirmed my innocence.
From the beginning I was convinced that I did nothing wrong, which now the final confirmation is a final verdict acquitting me of the charges against me", comments Jerzy Wiśniewski.
The White House tried to hide the transcript of the conversation with Zełenski
In a redacted report released on Thursday, the whistleblower wrote that President Donald Trump, speaking with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zełenski, had sought foreign interference in the US election, and that the White House was trying to hide a transcript of the conversation.
List of Presidents of Ukraine and the United States
In an anonymous report dated August 12, the whistleblower, who is believed to be an intelligence official, wrote: "As part of my official duties, I have been informed by many members of the U.S. government that the president has used his role to demand foreign interference in the 2020 elections in the United States."
"Trump used part of the conversation (with Zełenski) to pursue his own interests.
To be precise, he tried to press the Ukrainian leader to take steps that would help the president to be re-elected in 2020," the report says, as quoted by The Hill newspaper.
The Ukrainian leader was "made clear" that his contacts with Trump depended on him "show a willingness to play" on matters that president Rudy Giuliani's lawyer had informed him more precisely.
The author admits that he did not witness the conversation, but stresses that he was informed in detail about its contents by "many White House officials who had direct information about it" and their relationship overlapped.
"In the days following this conversation, I learned from many U.S. officials that high-ranking White House officials had intervened to "seal" all archival records of the conversation - and especially the literal transcript that was made, as is usually done, in the White House crisis room," it continues.
"High-ranking White House officials told me that White House lawyers "ordered them" to remove the electronic record from the information system where such records are stored.
The recording was transferred to a separate electronic system, which is typically used to store and manipulate sensitive information," the report's author wrote.
"In my opinion, these steps show that White House officials were aware of the importance of what happened during the conversation," the whistleblower said.
As the AP agency comments, this document is likely to speed up the investigation into the president's possible impeachment, and also contains valuable information about witnesses who can confirm this account.
A transcript of the conversation with Zełenski white house, after pressure from Congress, was made available on Wednesday, but not on the basis of an electronic recording, but based on the accounts of people who witnessed it.
The content of the report, redacted, was revealed a day later by the House of Representatives intelligence committee.
Also on Thursday, acting Director of U.S. Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified before the House of Representatives intelligence committee and offered explanations about how he handled the intelligence staff report.
Maguire said the whistleblower made the right choice and acted as required by law.
He also stressed that, in his opinion, the issue of the talks with Zełenski was an event "without precedent".
Democrats on the intelligence committee asked Maguire why he had blocked the whistleblower report from being made available to Congress; the Director of Intelligence replied that he did not have the power to disclose its content, the confidential nature of which guarantees the so-called privilege of the executive.
Part of Maguire's hearing by the committee took place behind closed doors.
On Tuesday, House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that she is under pressure from the Ukrainian authorities to harm her potential rival in the next presidential election, and the House of Representatives is initiated an investigation that could lead to Trump's impeachment.
A day later, she said that a transcript of Trump's conversation with Zełenski confirms that the U.S. president broke election and security standards.
U.S. election law prohibits the use of foreign states.
However, the Justice Department said the president had not broken electoral law. On Thursday, White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said there was "nothing improper" in the conversation, and the report "has nothing more than a collection of third-hand accounts and press clippings glued together."
"The White House will continue to criticize this media hysteria and the false narrative propagated by the mainstream media," she added.
Ghana wins two ICAO awards
Ghana won two prestigious awards during the 40th International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Assembly in Montreal, Canada.
The Safety Award recognises that Ghana has achieved africa's highest number of Aviation Safety Oversight points, i.e. 89.89 percent in terms of interim Effective Deployment Rate (EI).
This occurred when ICAO completed its ICVM audit on 3 April 2019 in accordance with the UN Aviation Agency's Universal Security Oversight Audit Programme.
The security award was a recognition of the country's high commitment to implementing ICAO-recommended security standards and protocols at airports and in Ghana's airspace.

Trump nominates Peter Gaynor as FEMA chief: White House
Peter Gaynor, acting administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), smiles as he testifies at a meeting of the Senate Subcommittee on National Security Budgets on FEMA's fiscal year 2020 proposal on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S. April 3, 2019.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House announced on Thursday that U.S. President Donald Trump has nominated Peter Gaynor as head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
Gaynor, fema's deputy administrator, serves as head of the agency that oversees the government's response to disasters such as hurricanes or forest fires.
The agency has operated without an administrator approved by the U.S. Senate since March, when Brock Long vaced that position.
Long resigned after the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, to which FEMA reports, found that Long had misused government vehicles to travel between Washington and his home in North Carolina.
Another candidate for the position, Jeffrey Byard, was withdrawn earlier this month when a thorough background check revealed allegations that he was involved in a brawl at a bar.
Gaynor was expected to be nominated for the post.
A majority in the Senate will be required to approve his nomination for the role.
The White House reported that before Gaynor became fema's deputy administrator in 2018, he worked in emergency management in Rhode Island state and served in a marine infantry.
Henrik Ingebrigtsen, Norwegian runner, considers finger amputation
The 28-year-old runner specialized in the 1500 metres, winning gold medals at the 2012 European Championships (Helsinki), silver in 2014 (Zurich) and bronze in 2016 (Amsterdam).
He is also the 2018 European 5000 metres runner-up in Berlin.
He explained that this is not a new ailment and that he had already undergone one operation immediately after the 2016 Games, but the pains have returned and have intensified a lot this season.
Pain makes me put my foot differently, which in turn changes the layout of my body, there are other unnatural loads and I begin to feel pain in other places, for example, in the hip.
For this reason, I could not prepare enough for the world championships, and for two weeks the pain is so severe that I have difficulty putting on spikes – said the runner on the air channel NRK.
The player's father and coach, Gjert Ingebrigtsen, admitted that after long discussions with his son, they had come to the conclusion that the only solution not to end his career and participate in next year's Tokyo Olympics would be an amputation.
It seems that this is the only, although drastic, solution and the decision has already been made properly.
"If a part of the body hurts, then it is necessary to get rid of it, and in total Henrik does not need this finger so much, and in this situation it is necessary to forget about the cosmetic aspect," he explained.
Police shut down illegal marijuana e-cigarette factory in San Gabriel Valley - CBS Los Angeles
EL MONTE (CBSLA) - Police closed an illegal marijuana e-cigarette factory in the San Gabriel Valley on Thursday.
An airstrike was carried out on the office building at 9600 Telstar Avenue at about 4:37 p.m., during which police searched for illegal e-cigarettes containing marijuana and found large straws containing butane hashish oil - a cannabis concentrate.
According to Lt. Christopher Cano of El Monte Police, officers also found a device that was used to replenish vapation cartridges.
"This process is very dangerous," says Cano.
Cano, who once worked on drugs, says that distilling oil used in vaping products is a potentially flammable process.
"An ordinary electrostatic spark from our clothes can ignite these fumes, causing not only a fire, but also a concentration, even an explosion," he says.
"If we have a lot of salts and the like in the room, after one explosion there will be another, causing not only a fire, but also an explosion that could sweep the whole complex off the surface.
A special task team was called to the office building to take care of illegal and potentially hazardous substances.
At the moment, the value of confiscated products and equipment is unknown.
Detectives say they received an anonymous tip that allowed them to obtain a search warrant so that illegal activity was detected.
Investigators are still trying to find out who is behind this illegal business.
According to them, the person responsible set up an interest in this place because the office was empty.
The investigation is ongoing and officers want to make sure that illegal products have not hit the street, given recent articles about the harmfulness of vaping.
"People don't really know what products they're buying," says Cano.
"They can be mixed with other harmful chemicals.
This can put our community and children at risk, so we always warn them against reaching for these kinds of things.

Exhibition of Elizabeth I's lost dress at Hampton Court Palace
Interspersed with silver thread, the dress made of the finest silk camper was exquisitely decorated with embroidery depicting vegetation, animals and butterflies.
For Eleri Lynn, curator of the Historic Royal Palaces exhibition, this meant only one thing.
The faded fabric hanging from 100 years on the wall of the tiny rural parish church she was looking at could only be a lost part of Elizabeth I's wardrobe.
Three years after Lynn accidentally stumbled upon a sumptuous altar fabric in Bacton, Herefordshire, Elizabeth's lost gown is due to go on display at Hampton Court Palace next month, close to the same rooms where the Tudor queen was allowed to wear it more than 450 years ago.
A measure of the significance of this discovery is that only one more element of the 16th-century dress survived from the entire collection of royal dresses.
While there is no clear evidence that Elizabeth ever wore this gown, three years of research has strengthened experts in the belief that she must have been part of the royal wardrobe.
"Silver heads", an incredibly expensive fabric, was legally reserved exclusively for the most important members of the royal court, and the virtuosity quality of embroidered plants and flowers, later enriched with deer, dogs, butterflies, fishermen and bear, indicates that the garment belonged to the most excellent of people.
The dress, at the time it was sewn, could have cost the equivalent of a Tudor estate.
"Moreover, in the 1990s, At the end of Elizabeth's reign at the end of elizabeth's reign, she felt threatened by other women outside and would not tolerate rivals wearing such exquisite fabrics," lynn says.
"As this is a very important statement, I have asked a lot of people from the community to look at the dress.
I was really pleased that when they saw the dress, they also enjoyed it and were practically convinced that we had an element of royal wardrobe in front of us.
The long, re-life of the dress, trimmed to serve as an altar fabric at the dark St Faith Church in Bacton, is not as unexpected as you might think.
Bacton is the settlement from which Blanche Parry came, the closest Lady of the Court to Elizabeth, who served the Queen throughout her long life and with whom this fabric was equated in local legends.
Although the dress was created after her death in 1590, experts believe that Elizabeth had to give it to parry's family or parish in memory of Blanche before her death in 1603.
After more than a thousand hours of restoration work, four hundred of which have passed on the most delicate manual sewing with specially dyed silk and thin surgical needles, the altar fabric will go on display next to the portrait "Rainbow Portrait" on loan by Hatfield House, one of the most famous paintings of the time depicting Elizabeth dressed in a similar dress.
"When you work with historical fabrics, you really start to respect the craftsmanship of the people who made them," says Libby Thompson, head of conservation work, most of which took place in a converted greenhouse on the grounds of Hampton Court Palace - the only place large enough to accommodate some of the priceless palace tapesties.
"Looking at the embroidery on the front and back, I began to feel great respect for those who made it.
I've never worked on something so elitist.
The lost dress of Elizabeth exhibition will begin on 12 October at Hampton Court Palace
Fitch confirmed Poland's rating with a stable outlook
Fitch confirmed on Friday poland's long-term foreign currency rating at "A-" level, the communication states.
The outlook for the rating remained stable.
"Fitch points to strong macroeconomic fundamentals and a well-diversified economy, supported by a reasonably conducted economic policy and a strong banking sector," reads a press release from the Ministry of Finance.
As added, Fitch pointed out that Poland was at the peak of the business cycle, and in 2019-2021 the real growth rate of Gross Domestic Product in Poland will be 4.1 percent, 3.3 percent and 2.9 percent, respectively.
The agency forecasts that the general government deficit to GDP will remain below the 3 percent limit between 2020 and 2021, at 2.3 percent and 1.9 percent, respectively.
"The government debt-to-GDP ratio in 2019 will be 50.5 percent, according to the agency, and in subsequent years it will be lower (an average of 48.3 percent in the period 2020-2021)," it reads.
Rating of Poland
The autumn round of reviews of Poland's rating on October 11 will be completed by SP and Moody's.
Poland's rating in fitch's assessment remains the same as that issued at the end of March 2019.
At that time, the agency confirmed Poland's rating at "A-" with a stable outlook.
Among the three largest credit rating agencies, Poland's creditworthiness is rated the highest by Moody's – at the level of "A2".
The Polish rating according to Fitch and SP is "A-", one level lower than Moody's.
The outlook for all assessments is stable.
What is a rating?
Credit rating agencies are set up to assist investors in assessing the scale of the risk of their investment activities.
The rating is granted to companies, banks and states.
For the latter, each assessment translates into economic attractiveness.
A rating is nothing more than a credit rating.
On the basis of it, decisions are made about to whom and for how much to borrow money.
Sometimes such information also suggests to whom it is best not to give any loans at all, because there is a considerable risk that the money will not be recovered.
A lower rating carries a higher risk.
Higher risk, on the other hand, is high interest on the loan.
Any assessment must be reasoned and argumentated.
The rating can be manipulated, but in this case the agencies risk reputational damage.
At the moment, more than 90 percent of the global rating services market is controlled by three agencies: Standard Poor's, Fitch and Moody's.
Each of them applies its own rating system.
"Five Confederations": First 1000 plus
The "Five Confederations", the main assumptions of the electoral programme, were presented on Friday in Koszalin by candidates for the Sejm from ward 40 applying for a seat from the list of KW Confederation of Freedom and Independence.
The leader of the Kosovar list to the Sejm Krzysztof Chmielewski presented the slogans "fives of the Confederation".
"Firstly, the 1000-plus program for Poland, secondly, the quick and fair courts, thirdly the cultural voucher and the education voucher, fourthly, national security, fifthly, it is a healthy life," Chmielewski said.
He pointed out that "Poles must finally start earning with dignity", which is why the Confederation wants to eliminate income tax and, as Chmielewski said, "the problem with the tax-free amount will solve itself".
"Poles need to give a choice of where they want to save their money for retirement, that is, zero PIT and voluntary ZUS for all", said the leader of the list about the assumptions of the "1000 plus program for Poland".
Aleksandra Zadencka, who started from the second place on the list, referring to the program slogan "healthy life" said that "food is getting worse quality" and to change this, it is necessary to "support Polish farmers, Polish agriculture", to work for GMO-free crops.
As she said, the Confederacy is also in favour of stopping "stigmatizing cannabis."
Zadencka declared the Confederacy's support for the "development of construction using natural raw materials".
She also advocated 'voluntary vaccination' on behalf of her group.
"The right to informed consent must not be violated," she added.
Subsequent candidates for the Sejm from the Kosošaliński district stressed that the Confederacy is in favour of "carrying out a profound reform of the judiciary", which would include m.in. the examination of the case by a judge "day after day".
They also advocated that the education subsidy should go to schools without the intermediary of local authorities, that is to say, without the additional costs associated with the maintenance of officials.
The Confederation is also in favour of a "strong Polish army, based on Polish industry and Polish soldiers".
Candidates for the Sejm stressed the need to increase the size of the army.
According to them, easier access to weapons is also needed.
On economic issues, they stressed the need for 'permanent access to energy'.
"We can gasify coal, we have a lot of geothermal energy deposits, we also need to consider returning to the idea of a nuclear power plant," said Piotr Karpiński, fifth on the electoral list.
Mexican cartel boss faces one-third of U.S. drug charges
Chicago - Just after sunrise on chicago's West Side, CBS News reported on the morning pursuit of drugs.
Brian McKnight of the Office for The Fight against Drugs (DEA) showed in full light what was going on.
Last year in Chicago, nearly 800 people died from drug overdoses.
McKnight stated "probably 90%" of the drug in Chicago came from Mexico.
The DEA focuses on the Mexican drug lord, Nemesio Cervantesie, simply known as El Mencho.
"He is a top priority for the DEA and directly for federal executives in the United States," said Matthew Donahue, the DEA's chief agent in Mexico.
The prize for El Mencho reaches $10 million.
He helped uncover dozens of El Mencho drug labs in the jungle.
The El Mencho Cartel's Jalisco Nueva Generacion, or CJNG, is responsible for at least a third of drugs reaching the US by land and sea.
According to the Justice Department, the cartel smuggled "tons" of cocaine, methamphetamine and heroin contaminated with fentanyl.
A $10 million reward awaits El Mencho's head.
Ironically, he lived in California about 30 years ago, where he was arrested on drug charges and eventually deported to Mexico.
It was there that he formed a brutal cartel.
It has a huge amount of weapons, RPGs, 50 caliber weapons.
Basically, he has his own SWAT teams," Donahue added.
El Mencho protects his empire with impunity by means such as shooting down a Mexican army helicopter, killing six people, or participating in a public hanging this summer.
In recent years, the brutality of the cartel has led to thousands of murders.
According to mexican government statistics, there are about 94 murders every day.
Mexican drugs in Chicago are so toxic that they cannot be dealt with without protective equipment.
In the laboratory, a packet of cocaine is branded a smuggler.
For more than a third of them, traces lead to the El Mencho cartel.
"He is responsible for sending poison that kills innocent women and children," Donahue said.
So when someone's child dies, according to Donahue, there is a "good chance" that the drugs come from El Mencho.
Last year, more than 67,000 Americans died from overdoses.

Run, jerk and fight - Sport
On Saturday, first-division Stomil will take on Podbeskid and is looking to win.
Stomil's players have been undefeated for three years.
Piotr Zajączkowski's men scored seven points in that time, as they won against Stala Mielec and Chojniczanka Chojnice, and in the last match there was a goalless draw in Suwałki.
Now olsztyn team on Saturday at 18 will take podbeskidzie, which is listed as one of the favorites for promotion to the Premier League.
Stomil's closest rivals are fourth in the table and have a point of advantage over the Olsztyn team.
Podbeskidzie on trips this season played six times and scored two wins, draws and defeats While Stomil feels very good at his facility - in the stadium at al. Piłsudskiego 69a piotr Zajączkowski's team won three times and lost once.
In total, in ten rounds olsztynianie accumulated 17 points and are at the top of the table, although after two defeats at the start of the competition nothing foreshadowed it.
"Every change takes time to produce results," explains Piotr Skiba.
"And in the end, something intertlocked with us, we believed in ourselves, besides, we can work under normal conditions.
We just focused on playing football.
There are clean heads, there is a good atmosphere and everyone knows what to do because we have a strong training staff."
On Tuesday, Stomil's players eliminated Ruch Chorzów from the Polish Cup, but they needed extra time and a series of penalties.
Piotr Skiba, Grzegorz Lech and Janusz Bucholc did not go to the south of Poland, because coach Zajączkowski gave these key players a rest before Saturday's clash with Podbeskidzie.
However, in Chorzów played returning from injury Jakub Mosakowski, who finally scored his long-awaited goal.
"It's always fun to score, and I got to the point where we can continue to play in the cups (Mosakowski equalized at 3-3 in 119. minute - ed.).
My dad often bit me and laughed that I couldn't score, and I always told him I was going to score at a point he wouldn't expect."
Now Mosakowski hopes to return to the starting line-up, especially since due to yellow cards he can not play Oleg Tarasenko.
"That's why I push hard in training to be able to play in the first team," mosakowski says.
"In Chorzów I did everything to present myself as best as possible.
But whether I play or sit on the reserve bench, I'll still be just as supportive of the team.
Because the most important is the team and three points in the match against Podbeskidzie.
We're definitely going to have a tough meeting where you'll have to run out, yanme and fight."
In the middle of the Olsztyn defense can still play Rafał Remisz, who recently also suffered an injury, so whether he will perform, we will find out only on Saturday, especially since coach Zajączkowski traditionally until the end of the personnel case tries to keep secret.

This was also the case, or rather – it was supposed to be, in The Silesian Piekars.
It is known – a special guest should be especially welcomed.
Before the meeting with the Prime Minister, the presenter in the room decided to conduct a general test.
Like a consummating chieftain, he tried to encourage the crowd to chant the name of the head of government.
"This will not be a greeting to me, but to Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki!
Also louder, louder my dears!", encouraged the enthusiastic.
Unfortunately, the crowd did not fully get carried away by the hot talk of the presenter and reluctantly answered "Ma-te-usz", but the recording of the enthusiastic chieftain makes a furore on the net.
Ronald Lee Haskell: Man convicted of murdering his ex-wife's family in Texas
Ronald Lee Haskell, 39, was convicted of the 2014 murders of Stephen and Katie Stay and four of their five children in Spring, Texas.
According to authorities, he entered Stay's home on July 9, 2014, demanding that his wife, Melannie Haskell, with whom he was separated, be disclosed.
She wasn't there, but there was her sister, Katie Stay, and her family.
Stephen Stay, 39, Katie Stay, 33, two boys, ages 13 and 4, and two girls, ages 9 and 7, were killed when Haskell opened fire, according to the Harris County Sheriff's Office.
Only one family member survived, then 15-year-old Cassidy Stay.
Authorities said she was seriously injured, but she managed to recover completely.
On Thursday, jury members rejected Ronald Lee Haskell's defense on the basis of insanity.
The jury will meet again on Monday to deliver its verdict.
Quantum internet getting closer to reality -- ScienceDaily
U.S. Army research moves the quantum internet one step closer.
Such an internet could offer military capabilities in terms of security, detection and accuracy of time-keeping not available with the traditional approach to networking.
The Center for Distributed Quantum Information Processing of the Military Research Laboratory for the Development of Combat Capabilities of the U.S. Army looked at researchers from the University of Insbruck, who managed to achieve a record transfer of the tangled state between matter and light – at a distance of 50 kilometers using fiber optic cables.
Entanglement is a correlation that can arise between quantums such as quantitors.
When two cubits are tangled and one of them is measured, this will affect the measurement made on the other, even if the other cubit is physically distant.
'These [50 kilometres] are two orders of magnitude further than previously possible and this is a feasible distance to start building intercity quantum networks,' said Dr Ben Lanyon, an experimental physicist at the University of Innsbruck and lead researcher on the project, whose findings were published in the journal Nature, a section of Quantum Information.
Intercity quantum networks would consist of remote nodes of physical qubit networks that are tangled together despite their long physical distance.
The researchers concluded that this dispersion of the tangled state is essential for the creation of a quantum internet.
'This demonstration is a major step forward in achieving a large-scale dispersed state,' said Dr Sara Gamble, co-head of the military programme supporting the research.
The quality of the tangled state at the other end after the fiber optic is also high enough to meet some of the requirements of some of the most difficult applications of quantum networks.
The research team started the experiment with a calcium atom trapped in an ion trap.
Using laser beams, the researchers entered the quantum state into the ion, while at the same time arousing it to issue a photon in which quantum information was stored.
As a result, quantum states of the atom and light particles were tangled.
The challenge is to send the photon with a fiber optic cable.
'The photon emitted by the calcium ion has a wavelength of 854 nanometers and is quickly absorbed by the optical fibre,' lanyon said.
Therefore, his team initially sent a light particle through a nonlinear crystal illuminated by a strong laser beam.
The wavelength of the photon has been converted to the optimal value for long-distance transmission – the current standard telecommunications wavelength is 1550 nanometers.
The researchers then sent this photon through a 50-kilometer fiber optic cable.
Their measurements show that the atom and light particles were still tangled even after the wavelength was converted and this distance was taken.
"The decision to choose calcium means that this result paves the way for the formation of a tangled network of atomic clocks over long physical distances, since calcium can be co-inseulate with a high-quality "clock" cubit.
The Army has a very strong interest in large-scale tangled clock networks due to applications for precise positioning, precise navigation and time synchronization," said Dr. Fredrik Fatemi, a military researcher who also co-manages the program.
