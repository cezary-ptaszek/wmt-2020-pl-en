Bosnians protest against Croatia's plans for radioactive waste dump
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered in northwestern Bosnia in protest at neighbouring Croatia's plans to store some of its waste from the region's only nuclear power plant near the Bosnian border and the main river known for its natural beauty.
Demonstrators in the Bosnian town of Novi  Grad demanded that Croatia abandon plans to build a landfill site at a former military barracks in the town of Trgovska  Gora and declared their fight against the project.
Waste from the Krškonuclear power plant would be stored at thefacility.
Bosnians holding banners with the words "I want a healthy future" and "Stop – (river) Una needs us", said that a radioactive waste dump could endanger the River Unie and the lives of about 250,000 inhabitants.
We must say NO,
Miroslav Drljaca, mayor of Novi Gradmunicipality, told the crowd.
We must fight to protect our way of life and our Una..
The Krško power plant, located in Slovenia, was built in the 1980s. It also belongs to Croatia in the 20th century.
Representatives from both countries are due to meet next week to discuss the issue of additional landfills.
Croatian public television HRT reported on Friday that it had not yet been decided in Croatia whether to build the landfill on its own or to pay for the storage of part of the waste in a new facility constructed by Slovenia.
Croatian Minister for Environment and Energy Tomislav  Coric told reporters that Croatia also has a problem with the disposal of institutional waste from schools, hospitals and prisons and hopes to find a holistic solution.
In Bosnia, activists, officials and residents on each side of the country's ethnic division insisted that Croatia find a different location in parts of the country closer to the power plant.
"Why does Croatia in its entire area say that Trgovska  Gora in Bosnia is the best place?"  Drljacaasked.
We cannot be humiliated!

U.S. Congress agreed to sell 32 F-35s to Poland
The U.S. Congress, for a statutory 15 days after the State Department approved the possible purchase by Poland of 32 F-35 multirole fighters, did not object to the deal, meaning that the last condition was met before the purchase negotiations began.
The decision of Congress, although not unexpected, is of great political importance.
"Once the Sale has been approved by the State Department, and now through Congress, I don't see any major obstacles," said John V. Venable,senior counsel for Defense Policy at the Washington- based conservative  think  tank  Heritage  Foundation.
The expert explained that under the Arms Export Control Act of 1976, the federal government, represented by the State Department, must notify Congress of any planned sale of arms abroad 15 days before signing the agreement if the value of such a transaction, in the case of arms sales to a NATO member state, exceeds $50 million.
The value of the proposed transaction for the purchase of 32 F-35 fighters by Poland is estimated at $6.5 billion. This amount includes the costs of technical and logistical assistance, anaesthlytic equipment and pilot training.
The main supplier of F-35 aircraft – if this transaction is finally finalised – will be the US arms company Lockheed Martin, and its subcontractor is the engine manufacturer for F-35A fighters concern Pratt  and Whitney.
In May, Defence Minister Mariusz Błaszczak proposed the purchase of us fifth-generation F-35 fighter jets on behalf of the Polish authorities.
The Polish offer was discussed in June this year during a meeting between President Andrzej Duda and President Donald Trump at the  White House.
The implementation of this agreement, if finalized, will be supervised by Pentagon representatives as part of the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program.
As part of the FMS program, Poland has already acquired m.in. Patriot anti-missilesystem.
The price of one F-35 fighter at the time of poland's offer to purchase was – without armament and technical assistance – about $89.2 million.
As the PAP reported, american military experts, who wished to remain anonymous, said the price quoted in the preliminary negotiations was "the maximum price, much higher than the price to be negotiated."
"Prices are falling sharply, currently the price of one F-35 is below $80 million, much less than the Eurofightercosts , which doesn't have the same advantages asthe F-35,"  Venable pointed out..
Pap interlocutors expressed the hope that the final negotiations on the purchase of US warplanes by Poland will be concluded later this year.
The possible participation of Polish subcontractors in this transaction – i.e. offset – will be discussed directly with the American manufacturers of F-35 fighter jets.
What is Münchhausen'sreplacement team, referred to in payton  Paytona  Hobart's"Election" on  Netflix??
Carers and parents with the above disorder pretend that their healthy child eats sick.
Payton Hobart's  Electionseries will hit Netflix  Netflixtoday.
It tells the story of Payton  Hobart, who wants to become president of the United States of America, but first he must become president of the student government in hishigh school.
In ryan murphy's series, the creators of "American Horror Story" and "Glee", we will see Gwyneth  Paltrow, Ben  Plat  and Lucy  Boynton.
Without revealing too many details to those who have not yet had the opportunity to see the show, it touches on the subject of Münchhausen's replacement syndrome – a mental illness found in caregivers who act as if the healthy person they are dealing with was affected by a physical or mental illness.
There are different types of this condition, e.g. Münchhausen  syndrome, which causes symptoms of a particular disease.
Münchhausen's  replacement syndrome is to simulate that the person in our care has certain ailments.
It is also called an imaginary and induced disease, and is treated as violence against a child.
This is a rare condition that usually involves a parent exaggerating symptoms or causing symptoms to make it look like their child is sick.
What are the symptoms of Münchhausen replacement syndrome??
The symptoms of this disease may vary, but the NHS notes the following examples of behaviour:
Convincing medical staff that a child looking healthy, however, feels bad.
Exaggerating or coming up with symptoms.
Falsification of results to make a child sick, e.g. administration of glucose into urine samples to make it look like the child has diabetes.
Inducing symptoms of the disease, e.g. giving children unnecessary medicines and other substances.
How common is Münchhausen's replacement syndrome??
It is difficult to estimate how often this disorder occurs, since many cases of the disease are not reported.
A study published in 2000 shows that in more than two years there were 89 cases of this disorder per 100,000 people.
What should I do if there are suspicions that the child may be in danger?

Police claimed the children were in highly dehumanising conditions. The school authorities deny this claim.
A resident claiming to be Shehu, a preacher at the school, said: "They don't tell the truth because all the children were there with their parents' consent.
Before the children were admitted to school, the parents signed the form.
Parents brought food to their children every day and knew what the conditions were.
We were extremely surprised by the arrival of the police and the evacuation of children, as well as the removal of all student food provided by parents before the school closed.
That's not right because parents can certify that their children are in poor conditions, according to police.
He added that former Police Commissioner Abdurrahman- who once visited the school to check the level of childcare - had never had any objections.
"He claimed that childrenare studying the Koran and nothing else."
However, Public Relations Police Officer Yakubu Sabo said that once the state government was handed over, the children would join their parents.
"They were kept in dehumanizing conditions on behalf of subjecting or acquiring Koraic knowledge.
Many of them had scars on their backs, which proves that they were beaten.
That's why we're investigating the school to find out its owner," he added.

Siemoniak: Tusk or Kidawa-Błońska will be president
"I believe that Donald Tusk and Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska have a chance to win elections with President Andrzej Duda," says Tomasz Siemoniak.
Deputy Head of civic platform Tomasz Siemoniak in an interview with Polsat News talked about the scandal involving the head of nik.
"This case is disqualifying for Marian Banasia.
He can become a minister of culture from some entertainment affairs, not the head of the NIK or a finance minister.
Not someone who is responsible for billions, for taxes," he said.
"This issue is a very serious state crisis," he added.
Siemoniak also talked about Claudia Jachira's candidacy..
"Antoni Macierewicz is on the PiS lists.
A man who not only said things, but did them.
He accused the former heads of the SKW of spying for Russia, destroyed their lives, destroyed their families.
Why doesn't anyone call for Antoni Macierewicz not to be on the lists?" he asked.
"People younger than us have a different aesthetic.
I think Jachira, who has already apologized for one of the things she has already apologized for, also feels that she sometimes exaggerates.
Let's not make this a campaign problem," he added.

'Besieged' masked Central Coast child rapist forced to look at his victim in court
Dressed in a masking outfit, the man grabbed the 12-year-old from behind and dragged her into thick bushes on the Central Coast  in May 2017.
He then tied her to a tree and raped her.
Shortly after his arrest, a search warrant was executed at his home, where officers seized a number of items relevant to the investigation.
The man pleaded guilty to seven charges relating to the attack and to a further three relating to the seduce and sexual exploitation of another girl, aged 11, between August 2016 and August 2017.
The 12-year-old victim walked down the path, and as she looked back, she saw how he unexpectedly emerged from the bushes armed with a large branch and a knife.
When she begged to "stop, stop, stop," he grabbed her by the neck and forced her into the thickets.
The man said, "Quiet, don't shout.
Don't shout because I'm going to have to hurt you."
Holding a knife in his right hand, he tied her arms and legs with cable ties, then tied her to a tree and raped her for nearly an hour.
When he cut her off, the girl ran to school with a hysterical scream.
The man arrived at work around 9.30am without answering a few text calls and calls from colleagues.
His clothing was dirty and bore traces of grass and trees, and he claimed to have been involved in an accident related to a road rage attack in which he chased another driver in the bushes and fell from an embankment.
The man's sentencing hearing will continue on Tuesday.
Pope urges executive directors of technology companies to use AI for common good
On Friday, Pope Francis warned executive directors of technology companies, diplomats and financiers that the race to create artificial intelligence and other forms of digital achievement risks increasing social inequalities if the common good is not taken into account in the course of ethics.
Pope Francis delivered these words at a conference at the Vatican attended by government envoys and representatives of Facebook and Google, as well as philosophers, physicists and ethicists.
A small group of academicians and bishops of the Catholic Church gathered participants at the conference "The Common  Good in the Digital Age".
This three-day event is the latest evidence that the Vatican is interested in participating in the debate on the prospects and risks of Artificial Intelligence.
Technological developments in the art of war and the future of work, which will be increasingly played by machines, were discussed, as well as a case study investigating the Christchurch attack in New Zealand and the decisions made by social media companies in connection with the spread of the video recording the massacre.
During his address to the conference, Pope Francis praised the potential for technological progress, noting that machines at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution saved workers dangerous and monotonous work.
However, he warned that increasing dependence on robotic devices for profit is a risk of depriving people of the dignity of work.
"If technological progress were to cause increasingly visible inequalities, it would not be real and real progress," he warned.
If the so-called technological progress of humanity were to become the enemy of the common good, it would lead to an undesirable retrograde nature to some kind of barbarism dictated by the law of the strongest.
The conference organizers expressed their hope to benefit from the expertise of the participants and to identify possible future advisers of the Catholic Church on high-tech issues.
Martin Odegaard,a player on loan from Real Madrid, euphoric with his impressive assist.
Martin Odegaard  recorded an impressive assist on Mikel  Mikela  Oyarzbal's opening goal.
With a 2-0 win over Osasuna,Real Madrid climbed tothe top of the La Liga table and continued their unbeaten streak at home this season.
However, despite missing a single defeat in La Liga this season, Zinedine  Zidane is under enormous pressure due to a turbulent pre-season and a public quarrel with Welsh star Gareth  Bale.
The situation reached boiling point when Real Madrid were humiliated in the Champions League by Paris-Saint Germain (PSG).
Zinedine Zidane and  Real Madrid, however, have real talents at their disposal – against some of them the Frenchman currently has plans, against others he does not.
Vinícius Júnior is an example of such a star of Real Madrid's future and currently plays for the team.
However, it was Norwegian young player Martin Odegaard- who was loaned out to Real Sociedad- who caused a great stir by scoringan incredible assist in a La Liga match.
During real Sociedad's  meeting  with Alaves  Martin  Odegaard made an impressive assist on  Mikel  Oyarzabal's opening goal and Real  Sociedad finally won 3-0 in front of their own audience.
After picking up the ball from the right, Martin Odegaard  outmaneuvered the player from the opposing team, putting on a net, and then sent an incredible pass per centimeter between the other two players and his teammate left only to add a leg.
Willian Jose's  second goal  and  oyarzbal'sthird goal - this time from a penalty kick- secured a decisive victory for Imanol's menbefore Manu Garcia was sent off five minutes before the end of thegame.
Martin Odegaard  joined Real Madrid only as a 16-year-old in 2015, but struggled to live up to fans' expectations.
Now, at the age of 20, the Norwegian footballer finally seems to feel confident on the pitch.

Social activist Anna Hazarewas not surprised that the name of Sharad  Pawar , chairman of the Nationalist Congress Party, NCP, appeared in connection with a multimillion-dollar fraud at the State Cooperative Bank of Maharashtra.
The Investigative Agency executive director, abbreviated as ED, brought a case against Sharad  Pawar,his  nephew Ajit  Pawar , former Deputy Chief Minister of State of Maharashtra, and others in connection with the fraud.

When the case came to me, Sharad  Pawar's name was nowhere to be found.  
"How did his name come out, who gave it, only they know these things," Anna Hazaresaid on Thursday, when askedabout the ED case and  Sharad  Pakar's alleged links to the scam.
Anna Hazare, a critical evaluator of Sharad  Pawar,expressed hope that the truth would come to light as a result of theED's detailed investigation into fraud.
"ED will find out where his name came from in the case," said Anna Hazare,a multiple participant in the anti-corruption demonstration.
Sharad Pawar denies wrongfulness and claims that he was in no way affiliated with the bank, and questions the fact that the case was reported a few weeks before the Assembly elections in Maharashchscheduled for 21 October.
The former Union minister assured that he would not succumb to delhi's majesty, unequivocally referring to the central government led by the BJP party.
The NCP assessed the case of the Executive Director as politically motivated.

Boris Johnson referred to police regulator over close relationship with businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri
The Independent Police Conduct Authority (IOPC) will investigate whether he committed criminal offences during his time in public office as Mayor of London.
Greater London Council (GLA) said in a statement that its supervisor had registered an "issue related to the conduct" of the Prime Minister following accusations of preferential treatment for Arcuri due to their close acquaintance.
"There is a "procedureal issue" when there is information indicating the possibility of committing a crime," he said.
This does not mean that this has somehow been proven.
The IOPC will now consider whether it is necessary to investigate the matter.
The issue has been referred to the IOPC, which deals with complaints against members of the police services in England and Wales.
It was transferred to the police work oversight body because Johnson was the equivalent of a Police Commissioner and a Crime Commissioner at the time.
Johnson denied that any irregularities had occurred in connection with his close relationship with Arcuri.  
He had previously said he would comply with a london city council order and provide details about his relationship with Arcuri- but insisted that thecouncil was "focusing on the wrong problem."
The injunction follows reports in The Sunday  Times that Arcuri, an American woman who moved to London seven yearsago, received £126,000 in budget money, as well as privileged access to three foreign trade missions headed by then-Mayor Johnson.
As a result, the government froze a £100,000 grant to Arcuri-owned Hacker  House pending the investigation.
The government is facing embarrassing questions about the verification procedure carried out before the funds are allocated.
Digital Minister Matt Warman said in the House of Commons that his department's staff had "simply exercised due diligence" and that the company had a UK phone number.
However, according to numerous reports, calls to the number were redirected to an office in California, where 34-year-old Arcuriis now expected tolive.
The Prime Minister's close relationship with the businesswoman "was a mystery to the staff."
The GLA's decision to refer the Prime Minister to the independent IOPC police conduct office was met with discontent at 10 Downing  Street.
According to a source close to the government, it is a "politically motivated attack" and its timing is "overtly political" on the eve of the Conservative Party conference.
"The surveillance inspector did not provide any evidence to support the allegations and the Prime Minister was not given the chance to respond to him before the press release was published late on Friday evening," the source said.
Neither citizens nor the media can be fooled by such an overtly political law..
Earlier this year, The Standard journalists were told that Johnson's close relationship with a California businesswoman, who is assisted by a tourism and promotion agency in London, was a "mystery to employees."
Former london partners (LP) officials recalled that Arcuri had been given seats during Johnson's foreign trade trips as mayor, despite the fact that her companies were not considered "credible" at the time.
Third charged with drug offences in connection with Mac Miller's death
LOS ANGELES (AP) - A third man has been arrested and charged with drug offences in connection with last year's death of rapper Mac Miller following a drug overdose.
According to court documents, Stephen Walter is suspected of selling counterfeit fentanyl-seasoned oxycodone pills that Miller had in his possession before his death last September as a result of an accidental overdose of cocaine, alcohol and fentanyl, the powerful opioid responsible for an "epidemic" that has consumed several thousand lives in the United States.
Walter is accused of supplying pills that another man, Cameron Pettit,sold to Miller.
Court documents unsealed on Tuesday reveal that Pettit  received drugs from Walter throughout August.
Ryan Reavis- who was arrested earlier this week in Lake  Havasu City, Arizona - is suspected of being a "courier" for Walter, who supplied pills to Pettit..
None of the men were directly charged with causing Miller's death, nor did any of them provide a line of defence in their case.
Walter, who was granted parole in a 2005 drug case, is in custody and has already been sentenced to five months in prison for breaching the terms of his release.
Prosecutors involved in the case, which was first reported on Thursday by celebrity website TMZ, are demanding that Walter remain in custody pending trial, arguing that there is a serious risk of the accused escaping.
The answer to the message left on his lawyer's answering machine did not immediately come.
Pettit was charged in federal court on September 4, and his defense attorney declined to comment.
Miller's rhyming lyrics are a candid conversation about his depression and drug use, making him a fan ofhip-hop's biggest stars..
The Pittsburgh-born  Miller, who really had his name as Malcolm James  Myers  McCormick, had been in a relationship with singer Ariana Grande for two years earlier in 2018.
After his death on Instagram, she posted a touching video featuring Miller and the song "Thank  U  Next", in which she mentions him lovingly.
Miller is one of the musicians whose deaths have been linked to opioid abuse in recent years..
Matthew Roberts,guitarist of 3  Doors Down, also died of an overdose in 2016, and fentanyl and hydrocodone were found in his body..
This article changes: Walter's correct spelling is "Stephen" and not "Steven."
9-year-old Nigerian creates more than 30 mobile games
A 9-year-old creates a fun game with the free Scratch  2 programming app.
Scratch 2 allows users to create games, animations and stories online or offline.
So far, Basil has generated more than 30 mobile games with it.
In today's game there is a bat that hides according to the program.
The player earns a point every time he catches a bat that comes out of the hideout.
I learned how to create games on an accelerated course.
"Now I create them when I get bored," Basil told CNN.
In March, his dad enrolled him in a five-day accelerated course for children between the ages of 5 and 15.
The course, organized by Codefest  International, aimed to provide children like Basil with access to new technologies such as robotics and virtual reality.
The boy's father, Basil Okpara  senior, claims that Basil played a lot of games on mobile devices.
"When he was 4 years old, I bought him a tablet because he always grabbed the phone and played on it.
He played Candy Crush and  Temple Run a  lot," his father told CNN.
But Basil's interest in creating games increased when he was 7 years old and received a burqa for devoting all his time to games.
"One day he was playing on a tablet as usual, and he was so engulfed in it that I got upset," his father said.
Out of anger, I said, "Are you still just playing, can't you think about creating your own games so others can play them?"
In saying these words, I was upset and didn't think he would take them seriously," he added.
Since then, Basil has shown an active interest in learning how to create their own games, persuading parents to buy a laptop and enroll it in a course where he learned the basics of game development.
Basil, who wants to be a scientist in the future, gives his games titles based on their content.
One of his games, "Mosquito  mash", is available on google  play  store..
Africa has the largest population of young people in the world and, like Basil, this population includes leadership in innovation on the continent.
Two Nigerian 12-year-olds were recently famous for using codes to create robots to separate their work at home.
In May, the Acrobot  team from ghana's women's secondary school won the Robofest  2019 competition for programming robots for stacking boxes.
And thanks to growing investment by technology giants like Google and Microsoft in Africa, Basil and his peers are on track for a career of coding stars.
Former Republican Party chairman in North Carolina pleads not to lie on corruption case
Court documents filed Friday show that the former Chairman of the Republican Party in North Carolina will admit in court that he lied to federal agents investigating the corruption of a major political donor.
According to wokanda Robin Hayes is expected to plead guilty next Wednesday.
According to a fact-based document prepared as part of a defense settlement signed by Hayes' lawyer, Hayes knew he was making a false statement to FBI agents investigating corruption in 2018.
The defence counsel's settlement has been sealed and it is not clear from the factual basis which charges Hayes will admit.
He was initially charged with collusion, corruption and making false statements.
Prosecutors accused former Congressman Hayes of participating in the insurance company's plan to direct campaign donations to the country's main insurance regulator in exchange for special treatment.
Director Greg Lindberg  and his two associates were accused of trying to bribe state Insurance Commissioner Mike Causey.
Lindberg is the founder of an insurance and investment firm, being one of the state's leading political donors in recent years, having donated more than $5 million to national and federal candidates and committees since 2016.
He mainly supported republican party targets and politicians, but also donated to Democrats.
His lawyer did not respond to Friday's email requesting comment.
Hayes' defense attorney Kearns  Davis did not respond to Friday's email requesting comment.
Court documents filed Friday show that Hayes lied to FBI agents in August 2018 when he said he had not spoken to Causey about employees at the state Department of Insurance.
According to the factual document, Hayes actually spoke with the Insurance Commissioner about Lindberg's request for changes to the staff employed by the market regulator.
Prosecutors allege that Hayes also helped Lindberg arrange  a meeting with  Causey and that he talked about the bribe directly with the regulator.
According to the April indictment, Lindberg required  special treatment for his insurance business and planned to donate up to $2 million to Causey's  2020 campaign again.
According to the indictment, the case also included a request to change the department official who controlled Lindberg'scompany.
Republican Causey reported the  alleged corruption attempt to federal agents and helped them gather evidence in the case.
No charges were brought against him.
According to the indictment, Lindberg's  accomplice ordered Hayes to donated $250,000 to  Causey's  campaign during an interview that also involved Lindberg  and  Causey.
During the conversation, Hayes initially protested, claiming that handing over such money would attract attention, but, according to the indictment, eventually relented.
"Whatever you want everyone to do, we'll do it," Hayes said, according to the indictment.
"Well, I'll take care of it."
A spokeswoman for the federal prosecutor did not respond to an email requesting further information about the settlement.

Facebook out of concern for users' well-being hides the likes counter on trial
As part of the world's first-time experiment to improve users' well-being, some people using polubieńFacebook soon won't see thelikes, reactions, and video views counter below others' posts.
Likes will only be hidden and visible to the post's author, and this change will be made in Australia following a similar test implemented on Instagram in July.
A new version of Facebook launched next Friday will also be launched in Australia.
Mia Garlick,Facebook's director of privacy in Australia,  polubień said the change was the result of a study on wellbeing and feedback from mental health professionals indicating that the likes counter may be tending to compare with others.
"The response from many anti-bullying groups working with us, as well as mental health organisations, has been really positive," garlick said..
Eliminating this counter will make people focus on the quality of their interactions and the quality of their content, not on the number of likes  or reactions.
Sharing with others through the platform is expected to be more enjoyable and not be perceived as a rivalry, she said.
Garlick ensured that companies that base their business on Facebook would continue to receive the same metrics and observations they had access to so far.
She said it was too early to say whether the test would be extended to other countries, as was the case with Instagram when Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy and Ireland were included in the test.
As with Instagram, which belongs to Facebook, there is no indication of when the experiment will end and whether the change will be made permanently.
"Users' initial comments about the new Instagram policies have been positive, but at this stage we are still learning and listening," she said.
Commenting on the site of the global experiment, Garlick  said Australia has very active, technically familiar Facebook and Instagram users.
We believe that this is an amazing country that will provide us with authoritative feedback indicating whether the new experience is valuable to people using our services or not.

TVP's "news" missed the Confederacy when describing the poll
According to a poll conducted by Pollster,in the elections tothe Sejm PiS would get 45% of the vote, KO 26%, Left 14%, PSL 7% and confederation 5%.
Even on the "Super Express" portal, for which the poll was conducted, the election threshold was even written about exceeding the electoral threshold.
In the main edition of "News", describing the same poll, the results of only the first four parties were presented, completely ignoring the Confederacy.
The leader, Edyta Lewandowska, made it clear that only four committees had crossed the electoral threshold and would have entered the Sejm.

This would give PiS independent governments.
Krzysztof Bosak, in a commentary on the whole situation, spoke of "public disgrace in terms of fairness to society".

Robert Winnicki, on the other hand, wrote on Twitter that ""TVP News" in subsequent actions against the Confederacy embarrassed Urban and Michnik".
He also pointed to the lack of reaction from right-wing journalists.
"But let us also look at those who are persuasingly silent.
These "righteous", "independent", "defiant".
In a few years they became a more primitive version of everything they reportedly fought against," he added.

Brother sentenced to life in prison for killing social media star Qandeel  Baloch
Qandeel Baloch, who became a star thanks to photos posted onsocial media, was strangled in July 2016.
The brother of Pakistani social media star Qandeel  Baloch was found guilty of her murder on Friday and sentenced to life in prison for the country's most high-profile "honour killing."
Baloch - who rose to fame by posting bold selfies - polite by Western standardsbut considered provocative in heavily misogynistic Pakistan - was strangled in July 2016.
Her brother Muhammad Waseem was arrested..
A few days later, he said at a press conference that he had no remorse for his actions and declared that he had "of course" murdered his sister and that her behavior was "unacceptable."
His lawyer Sardar  Mehmood told AFP that a court in the western city of Multan found his client guilty and sentenced him to life in prison in a long-awaited sentence.
"Inshallah  (if God allows), will be acquitted by a higher court," he said.
Earlier,Baloch's mother, Anwar Mai, told AFP that she hoped her son would be acquitted. Balocha
"He is innocent.
It was my daughter, and it was my son," she said.
Baloch's murder made headlines on the world's news outlets and renewed calls for action against an epidemic of so-called honor killings in which victims - usually women - are killed for violating patriarchal social principles.
Women were set on fire, strangled, shot or stabbed for offences such as choosing their own husband or, as in the case of Baloch,  for bringing their family "shame" by demonstrating their own sexuality.
Killings are usually carried out by a close relative.
Under Pakistani law, Qisas  (bloody money)  and Diyat  (retaliation) can ask the closest victims for forgiveness.
Three months after The Baloch murder,  parliament passed new legislation introducing a life sentence for honour killings.
However, whether the murder is considered an honorable offence remains the responsibility of the judge, which means that the murderers can theoretically invoke a different motive and be acquitted.
In baloch's  case, her parents initially insisted that their son should not be shown clemency under any circumstances.
However, devastated by the thought that he too might lose, they changed their minds and declared that they wanted his acquittal.
The international outrage caused by the murder prompted the Pakistani state to take an unprecedented step and declare itself an heir with his parents, forcing the case to move forward.
One of Baloch's more famous accomplishments is to offer to do striptease in front of the Pakistan cricket team and put on a decollete purple dress on Valentine's Day.
She was criticized and threatened, but many people, including young people, saw her as breaking the restrictions in a country where posing as a character modeled after Kim Kardashian could be considered a bold and political movement to empower women.
The roots of "honorable" murder lie in the tribal social norms that continue to dominate South Asia, and in particular norm women's behavior, although men can also be victims.

Anarchy doubles the number of displaced from northwestern Nigeria to 40,000: UNHCR
On Friday, the UN reported that rising violence has doubled the number of people displaced from northwestern Nigeria to around 40,000 in the past four months. People.
The UN refugee agency said the unrest had created a "new humanitarian emergency" that requires an inter-agency effort to raise $35.5 million by the end of the year.
Babar Baloch,spokesman forthe UN High Commissioner for Refugees, said the Islamist group Boko Haram, which has been leading the uprising in the north of the country for a decade, was not responsible for the recent attacks.
The increase in violence in the Nigerian states of Sokoto, Zamfara  and Katsina observed over the past 10 months is rather the result of the actions of organised armed groups.
"This paints a terrifying picture of anarchy and uncertainty," he told reporters on Friday.
He reported frequent reports of kidnappings, torture, extortion, murders and sexual assaults by assailants who also destroy homes and steal belongings.
Military and police have been sent to fight criminal gangs in the region.
However, the military is distracted from the fight against Boko Haram and the branch of the Islamic State in West Africa, which was separated from its former group in 2016.
"Refugees don't come with group names," he said.
But they come with horrible stories.
Refugees mostly make their way to neighbouring Niger.
In a statement, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said he expected more people to converge on Niger in the coming months as the security situation deteriorated, particularly in Sokoto state.
A new trial date has been set for a man accused of killing a woman and two children
A new trial date has been scheduled for a Guatemalan man accused of killing an Iowa resident and her two children.
Polk County District Court records show that 31-year-old Marvin  Escobar-Orellana is charged with three first-degree murders under what authorities say was a false name he originally gave to police: Marvin Esquivel-Lopez.
He has pleaded not guilty.
According to police, he fatally shot 29-year-old Flores-Rodriguez, her 11-year-old daughter and 5-year-old son on July 16 at a home in their home in Des Moines.
According to court documents, the new date of the hearing, i.e. 27 January, will give representatives of both parties more time to prepare.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials say Escobar-Orellana is in the United States illegally and was deported twice before the shooting.

The Sun: Boris Johnson facing cabinet revolt over demands wsto cut demands for BorisJohnson brexit  and reach a compromise agreement with Brussels
Just three weeks before the final summit of EU leaders, fears are growing among the most important people in the country surrounding the Prime Minister that more concessions will not be enough for him.
Boris Johnson is facing the risk of a rebellion from the Cabinet seeking to lower demands for Brexit and reach a compromise agreement with the EU.
There was a deadlock in the negotiations over a new customs system to replace the backstop mechanism for Ireland, as Brussels described the proposals for other arrangements offered by Johnson as "unworkable."
Crown ministers expect EU decision-makers, led by German Leader Angela Merkel, to offer the criticised Tory leader a compromise at the last minute in the form of a three-year time limitfor the backstop mechanism.
The Sun journalists spoke to three different Cabinet ministers, all of whom are preparing to confront the Prime Minister after the Tory annual conference next week in Manchester.
They will demand that the Prime Minister abandon the "aggressive" strategy developed by his close adviser Dominic Cummings in trying to bluff the EU and threaten to leave the Union without a deal and then accept a last-minute offer from the Union.
One cabinet minister described the Supreme Court's devastating verdict on Tuesday to end the suspension as a "warning sign" and added: "The only way we can leave the European Union on 31 October is to do so on the basis of an agreement.
We will never overcome arithmetic in the House of Commons, which works to our detriment.
The Prime Minister must now bend down and accept what he is capable of obtaining.
Aggressiveness doesn't pay off: it's clear that Cummings' plan burned on the ace.
We cannot fight on so many fronts.
A second Cabinet minister has pledged to hand Johnson over to try to push through former Prime Minister Theresa May's  deal if everything else fails.
The minister said: "If I have to, I will tell the Prime Minister to present again in the House of Commons the agreement proposed by Theresa  May."
There are many chances of it being voted on, and everyone is very keen to end this topic.
If we are forced to extend the deadline, it is the end of Boris Johnson and the end of all of us.
John Major accused Boris Johnson of not taking the negotiations seriously.
In a speech, the former Tory first minister said: "The Prime Minister tells us he wants a deal with the European Union.
However, we do not see him sitting in Brussels and working on it.
Instead, he forces bulls in Scotland, checks eggs in Wales and argues with citizens on the city's main streets - all in front of the world as if the election campaign was already underway for good."
A spokesman for the current Prime Minister admitted yesterday that the deal was still a long way off, adding: "No one should be under any illusions: there is a very long way to go to secure an agreement."
However, the spokesman also said that the Benna Act, which implements  brexitu the brexit put-off by three months in the absence of an agreement, "actively weakens our negotiating position" in Brussels.
He said: "There is no doubt that this law makes it difficult for us to negotiate, but despite it, the Prime Minister and his colleagues are still trying to make progress through hard work."
Brexit Secretary brexitu  Stephen  Barclay returns to Brussels today for more talks with Michel Barnier  on the EU side.
They will discuss a book on how the zone works for food and livestock throughout Ireland.

Lorraine Kelly: It was said that with a Glasgow accent I would never make a career in television
According to Lorraine Kelly, television bosses said she would "never make a career" as a presenter because of her Glasgow accent.
Recalling her 35-year career in the television industry, Kelly, 59, admitted that she felt "a lot of nervousness" before her first on-screen appearance.
"I was only 25 years old and very nervous," she said.
When I worked at BBC Scotland as a search and information checker, the chief executive said that through my Glasgow accent I would never be successful on TV.
I went to London to meet the whole TVteam and watch  the show before I took over my duties at the Glasgow office.
I'll never forget the interview with star  Bette Davis Anne  conducted  by Anne Diamond and Mike Morris that morning.
I didn't believe I was in the same room with a living legend.
I knew i wanted to stay here.
Before becoming a Scottish TVcorrespondent in  1984, Kelly began her career as a reporter for a local newspaper in East Kibride,  Scotland.
She then began running shows such as "GMTV", "ITV Breakfast"and "Daybreak" and later launched her morning show "Lorraine", which took its name from her name.
The 35th anniversary of her career will be celebrated with a special program, during which she will recall her best-remembered moments and interviews.
The presenter said the secret to her long-term experience in television is "passion and enthusiasm" and "curiosity," adding: "You have to work hard.
Be honest and authentic.
Prepare for programs and be both interested and interesting.
When she mentions media reports that touched her emotions, Kelly reveals that it was "very difficult" for her to report on the Dunblanebombing.
I had no idea that many families of slain or injured children were watching our live show from Dunblane the day after the horrific murder of sixteen children and their teachers.
One of the mothers, Pam  Ross, whose 5-year-old daughter Joanna was murdered, asked me for a private meeting, during which we talked for hours at her house.
The whole meeting took place silently, and Pam Ross and I have been friends since Joanna's funeral, in which I attended.
She added that it was "extremely difficult" to interview Kate  and  Gerry  McCann shortly  after their daughter Madeleine's disappearance in 2007 and that she "really admires their strength and courage."
They have to deal with the pain because they do not know what happened to their beloved daughter, and in addition to endure the most terrible comments of internet trolls.
I am with them with all my heart.
Programme on the occasion of the 35th Lorraine Kelly's tv anniversary will begin at 8.30am on Monday, September 30 on ITV.
Zimbabwe: Chiwenga  feared imprisoned
A senior government official claimed that Vice President Constantino  Chiwenga had rejected a presidential bid made by the late President Robert Mugabe at the height of the coup because he feared being imprisoned to confirm the military's takeover in November 2017.
As Reported by The Zimbabwe Independent last week, Mugabe offered Vice President Chiwendze to take over the presidency during his negotiations with the military as part of a coup.
However, a senior government official said on social media that Chiwenga had not rejected the offer out of fear, but because he had reviewed Mugabe's plan to use it to prove to world leaders and the African Union (AU) that he had actually lost during the coup.
In a Twitter thread confirming that zimbabwe's 37-year-old ruler wanted to hand over power to Vice President Chiwenda- notPresident Emmerson  Mnangagwa-  Jamwanda  2, for whom government officials confirmed he was a senior government official in the Office of the President and Council of Ministers, it was claimed that intense negotiations were underway at the time.
Government officials claimed that Mugabe had contacted Chiwenga through one of his envoys when he realized that power was out of his hands.
The mediation between the military authorities and the late former president took three stages, according to a senior government official.
The official claimed that among the participants in the negotiations wasa spokesman for President George Charamba, a person who was then the head of the Central Intelligence Organization Aaron Nhepera and a cleric representing the Roman Catholic bishop Fidelis  Mukonori..
The former head of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, Gideon  Gono,has been another element since Mugabe sent him on a one-man mission to hand over an offer of the presidency to  Chiwendze, who was head ofzimbabwe's Defence Force (SOZ).
A man who, after his death, was considered an icon of Africa even more than in his lifetime, tried in vain to get the AU to condemn military action in an attempt to persuade other African leaders to intervene.
The president's offer, made by the late (Mugabe) then Head of the Defence Forces (SSO) Chiwendze,was not an election.
"This was a desperate act to save a situation that had gained dangerously fast momentum by removing part of the deceased's family," theofficialwrote.
But there was also a bit of political tempting, with the help of the deceased he wanted to turn the situation around in a completely non-diplomatic way.
Suffice it to recall that the commanders declared that they had not overturned and would not overthrow the constitutional order, which would have caused them to conflict with the AU's position on coups.
The deceased (Mugaba) hoped that then the SSO (Chiwenga) would swallow the bait, abruptly interrupting the leaders' claimsthat they had not overturned the constitutional order.
The hope for the deceased (Mugabe) was that the AU, which, by the way, was still highly confused by the whole situation and how it would fit into its theoretical coup would then have no choice but to describe it as a coup, and therefore the call for military intervention would be credible.
It was in this spirit and with such a plucking that this offer was made.
Officials claimed that Mugabe made the move when he realized that the defense forces were no longer ready to protect him.
They said Mugabe was forced to sign a resignation letter after warning the principal that he risked a Gaddafi-style lynching.
Army chiefs told him they would not return shotguns against citizens if they moved into his Blue Roof mansion..
And at the same time Mugabe had two desires, namely to save his family and prove that the military had taken power," the official added.
The then SSO and the commanders correctly read the assumptions.
The envoy (Gono) carrying this desperate message was made clear – through a powerful metaphor – that isu  tiri  vemakwapa-makwapa  (we belong to the camouflage sect, i.e. the military), we are notpoliticians or compete with each other at the political level, claimed a senior government official.
Government officials say the military has notified military commanders in the area through an attaché who were in Zimbabwe that they have no intention of overthrowing Mugabe, but of cracking down on the "criminals" around him.
Mugabe tried to use the same strategy to re-tempt Mnangagwa to return from brief exile in South Africa so they could talk about coup and succession.
In addition to negotiations with the army, Mugabe also sought help in the region.
The people of South Africa, which is a key part of the process – not only because of their economic and regional power, but also because then President Jacob Zuma  was president of Sadc – refused to intervene, but made it clear that if the military invaded Mugabe's house, as he repeatedly feared in the background, South African troops would immediately arrive in Harare.
"It didn't work because Putin and the African leaders didn't choose this route," one informant told The Independent.
China needs strong leadership or will 'fall apart' as policy document states
China needs strong, unified Communist Party leadership, otherwise the country will "fall apart," the government said in a policy paper released on Friday on the eve of the 70th century. anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic.
The press office of the Chinese government said in a white paper that the country's successes since the Communists took power 70 years ago amount to party leadership.
China occupies a large area, has complex national conditions, but the difficulties of the administration are rarely seen here.
The document mentions that without a unified and strong leadership force, China will move towards division and disintegration, which will be disastrous for the world.
The Chinese authorities have long used a hard-hand policy to solve problems, as in the case of the suppression of pro-democracy protests in Beijing in 1989, on the grounds that the country must maintain stability.
President Xi Jinping, who will lead the celebrations of the anniversary of the world's second-largest economy on Tuesday, has further strengthened party rule since taking office at the end of 2012 and issued sanctions against those who may question power.
Xi also oversees a military modernization program that has knocked the region out of balance.
The document states that China does not seek to export its development model or want to import any foreign models, aiming only for peace and not for 'hegemony'.
The Chinese do not have in their genes the conquest of other nations or world domination.
In modern times, China has been oppressed by great powers, and wars and anxieties have left a deep mark on them as a result of their sufferings; China will never give others the suffering they have suffered.
China is celebrating its anniversary in uncertain times for a country embroiled in a bitter trade war with the United States and facing challenges due to a slowing economy, as well as anti-government protests in china-held Hong Kong.
The document says that China will never "trade" its most important interests or allow anything to harm its sovereignty.
With regard to the country's trade dispute with Washington, the document states that "the danger of trade wars and the further increase in tariffs do not solve the problems."
China is a mature economy with a full industrial system, a complete industrial chain, a wide market place and a strong economic growth rate.
The document adds that "trade wars will never weaken it."
China is certain to be able to face difficulties, turn the crisis into new opportunities and open up a new world.
It added that the United States should look rationally at China's development, as China does not intend to question the position of the United States, nor does it want to replace the United States.
The United States cannot control China, and even less likely to stop China's development.
Limiting and weakening other countries and conveying domestic misunderstandings abroad will not give the United States a strong position.
Jack Pałkiewicz's World: Dubai, the real face
Dubai's emirate is still searching for its own identity, torn between Bedouin tradition, Islamic religious radicalism and progressive extremism.
This trend-setting leader of global tourism awakens imagination and desires, tearing the vanity of wealthy snobbist hotels and attracting fortune-seeking investors and traders with the status of a tax haven.
Websites infect with enthusiasm for this city of dreams, which is an exciting temple of luxury and a concentrated concentrate of 21st century architecture in one.
Formed on the oil-rich sands, the emirate has become an Eden for those who love too much, five-star hotels, beautiful weather and swimming pools located hundreds of meters above the ground.
Many admire the ubiquitous glamour here, appreciate creative hyperactivism  and hysterical pursuit of avant-garde.
This is a city whose motto says it all: "surprise, dazzle and enchant."
And at almost every step.
But there are also those who can look at Dubai critically, calling it a city without character.
As the British writer Lawrence Osborne notes,"full of extremes and contradictions, the metropolis has taken on the dimension of shoddy burlesque."
It turned into a futuristic nightmare, completely dominated by the Guinness Book of Records, the emirate's unofficial constitution.
Because here everything has to be bigger and nicer than elsewhere in the world.
However, among the thicket of excesses and ostentatious excesses, there is a lack of something that in old Europe is perhaps not transparent, but important for the quality of life.
In Wroclaw, Berlin or Madrid everyone feels at home.
And in Dubai certainly not.
Fleeing from the world of charm, I broke his golden mask, revealing the second face of artificial paradise.
A face that is not spoken about or written about loudly.
I show the misery of Asians contrasting with the fairytale living conditions of the divine caste of ethnic Dubaiians,grandchildren of the ingested Bedouins.
I go to places of extreme poverty, for example, to a ghetto on the outskirts of the city, where an army of Asian workers live in cruel conditions.
It was in one generation that they built a desert Manhattan in slave conditions.
They came here with good wages and the opportunity to provide a decent life for their families, and they found a nightmare.
This tourist will never see, because it could blow up the myth of Dubai created over the years.
The growing criticism of the international community makes the topic of cheap labour highly embarrassing for the emir.
Spice Girls' Mel C banned from talking about diets at home after struggling with eating disorders
Melanie Chisholm of the Spice Girls admitted that there was a ban on diets in her home, after she struggled with eating disorders herself, eating only fruits and vegetables for years.
Spice sports for years did not eat and "obsessing exercise" due to the pressure of being a member of the world famous pop group, which later caused depression and eating disorders.
She now reveals that her experiences affect how she raises her daughter Scarlet, which is why she'doesn't let diets be talked about in her house'.
"Scarlet  is now 10 years old and I'm starting to see that she's more aware of her appearance," Mel said.
"I think one of the positives of the eating disorder experience is that I'm very aware of how I speak with it.
Applying positive language has now become my habit.
In an interview with Women's  Health  magazine, Mel, who rose to fame in the 1990s as a member of the Spice Girls, said that in the days before the rise of social media, "outrageous" comments about her had caused her complexes.
"I started looking at myself inappropriately, giving up certain food groups, practicing more and more obsessing until I started being underweight," he says.
"I was sick and it probably lasted a few years."
The photo that shook the world
A Polish girl and an American documentarian gave the world a testimony of the cruelty of war.
The legendary photo of Julien Bryan can be seen at the Museum of World War II in Gdansk
"Listen to my story.
I speak from the besieged city of Warsaw.
I can and must speak on behalf of the Polish people about what has happened here.
America must act, it must help!", began his radio speech documentarian, photographer, Julien  Bryan.
On the tragic September days of 1939 he was in the Polish capital, he saw the drama of the bombed city and its inhabitants.
His account echoed widely in the West.
The President of Warsaw, Stefan Starzyński, first helped him, borrowed a car, but then asked him to leave immediately for his own safety.
Bryan wrote a farewell letter to his family in the US, deposited it in an embassy safe and... Was.
For the next four weeks he tried to be wherever the Warsaw people were.
400 aircraft and artillery almost non-stop attacked the city.
Bryan captured in the pictures death, suffering, the struggle for survival in the ruins of the city.
Just before the surrender, he and embassy staff took the negatives across the ocean.
He continued to talk about Hitler's crimes.
He appealed to the world: "What happened to Warsaw will be Paris, London and even New York."
President Eleanor Roosevelt looked at his harrowing chronicles.
Soon, the U.S. began preparing for war.
"Dad was showing the truth and thus fighting German propaganda.
They were making films glorifying their chivalry.
They said they didn't attack women and children, and people believed them," says Sam Bryan, Julien's son.
Jury trial against former athlete accused of multiple rapes
A jury is on trial in a rape case brought against a former Delaware University baseball player who is accused of multiple sexual assaults.
On Friday, after 10 days of testifying and hearing arguments, jury members proceeded to decide the fate of 23-year-old Clay Conaway..
The woman, who is 21, claims Conaway  raped her when she went to his home in June 2018.
The incident took place three weeks after the two made friends on bumble's meeting page and sent a photo of the man to the woman, in which he appeared naked.
The woman is one of six accusing Conaway  of sexual assault between 2013 and 2018.
According to prosecutors, the hug, to which the woman consented, turned into rape, which was met with her opposition.
Defense attorneys cite the woman's conflicting relationships and memory gaps and argue that the woman probably regretted that there had been an intimate rapprochement.
Gold on two wheels: Polish bike for one million zlotys
A gold-plated bike worth a million zlotys could be seen at the jubilee, 10. edition at the Kielce BIKE-EXPO International Cycling Fair.
It's an extraordinary vehicle printed on a 3D printer.
Its constructor, 30-year-old Adam Zdanowicz, has just received an Oscar for him at the World Custom Bike Show in Las Vegas.
An unusual copy made a furore at the fair. - The bike is covered with gold spray chrome, under it is the highest sample silver.
This is an unusual coating made by my colleague from Żor.
"There is a saddle, there are pedals, there is a steering wheel, you could ride it normally.
It can develop a speed of 50 kilometers per hour.
It's an electric bike," the builder says.
"The bike body has been printed on a 3D printer.
These are cubes that form a kind of vortex.
I came up with the idea of this model riding my first bike home a few years ago.
I drew it on a piece of sheet and tipped it deep into the drawer.
The sketch waited five years for implementation.
The bike itself was built for three years", adds Adam Zdanowicz.
"It was cruelly difficult to hide all the elements under the bodywork.
Inside are batteries, wires, components forming a structure.
It is hidden under the bodywork ed in 11 elements on the steel frame of the bike.
There is also a hidden engine.
The handlebar for this bike was created a week before my departure to the United States for the World Bicycle Exhibition.
I couldn't quite decide what the steering wheel was going to be.
She folds up for transportation.
The bike weighs 90 kilograms," he concludes.
The gold-plated bike was recognized in Las Vegas for the most important competition category "Best amazing single customcopy".
Footage shows strong pollution of popular tourist destinations
Sydney Bay, surrounded by an opera house, Circular  Quayharbour, Luna Park and, of course, the famous Harbour Bridge, makes a significant contribution of $21.9 billion, pumped into the Australian economy annually by tourists visiting Sydney.
But there's an ugly truth hidden under the bridge.
Sydney's well-known bay is one of the most polluted waterways in the country, with a pollution volume equal to about 15 Olympic pools every year.
These terrifying statistics make one of our greatest tourist perks one of our dirtiest waters at the same time.
According to a new video entitled "Sydney Bay – upstairs and downstairs," the waters around Australia's most popular city are full of butts, plastic nets and bottles, lost shoes and clothing parts, and even dead animals, all flowing into the bay along with rainwater.
However, the biggest component suffocating our shipping channels is plastic.
"I would call it a paradox," says Dr Katherine  Dafforn,deputy director of the Sydney Harbour Research Program, in a video published on September 27, with the publication of the film deliberately coincides with World Tourism Day.
This body of water looks beautiful, but it is one of the most altered and contaminated river flows along our coast.
The CSIRO estimates that about 1,560 kg of plastic enters our waterways every hour, and most of it enters the bay through storm drains.
"After such heavy rainfall, the bay... it looks pretty tragic," Dr Daffornsaid.
Two-thirds of the pollution comes from rainwater.
However, as with the iceberg, the problem with Sydney Bay is much more serious beneath the surface of the water, as 70% of the plastic entering the ocean goes to the bottom of the sea.
"In my opinion, unless you spend time underwater, you can't really realize what's in the depths," said Richard Nicholls, owner of Dive  Centre  Manly,noting that he and his team pull about500 kg of plastic out of the water each year.
I think if more people knew (what's underwater), they would just be terrified.
It's overwhelming... more than half of what we find at the bottom are plastic nets.
The remaining 50% are things that are at least made of plastic.
When you look at the bay, it looks beautiful, and people can't believe that all this plastic and all this other garbage we're extracting right from under the surface.
Jeremy Brown, co-founder and managing director of Ocean Protect,said there are ways people - both locals and tourists - could help reduce the amount of plastic and debrisentering our waterways.
"It has to start at the source," he said.
We need to reduce the amount of plastic we use, recover materials better and be more aware of what we drain in the wastewater that eventually end up in the oceans.
If we destroy the ocean, we will be doomed, because 50% of the oxygen we breathe comes from the ocean.
It absorbs 30% carbon dioxide and our food source.
However, we can sort out this bay and restore it to its former glory, and it's very simple.
If we kill our oceans, we will also kill ourselves.
The footage, funded by recycling company TOMRA as part of its wider efforts to educate Australians on the environment and reduce the negative impact of beverage containers that often end up in the environment, coincides with a study on the relationship between plastics and mental health, the results of which were published this month.
